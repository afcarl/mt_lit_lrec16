      <P>
        <S ID="S-41447">The emergence of phrase-based statistical machine translation (PSMT) (<REF ID="R-15" RPTR="26">Koehn et al., 2003</REF><REF ID="R-16" RPTR="29">Koehn et al., 2003</REF>a) has been one of the major developments in statistical approaches to translation.</S>
        <S ID="S-41448">Allowing translation of word sequences (phrases) instead of single words provides PSMT with a high degree of robustness in word selection and in local-word reordering.</S>
        <S ID="S-41449">Recent developments have shown that improvements in PSMT quality are possible using syntax.</S>
        <S ID="S-41450">One such development is the pretranslation reordering approach, which adjusts the source sentence to resemble target-language word order prior to translation.</S>
        <S ID="S-41451">This is typically done using rules that are either manually created or automatically learned from word-aligned parallel corpora.</S>
        <S ID="S-41452">One particular variety of this approach, proposed by <REF ID="R-07" RPTR="9">Elming (2008)</REF>, uses a large set of linguistic features to automatically learn reordering rules.</S>
        <S ID="S-41453">The rules are applied nondeterministically; however, phrase-internal wordalignments are used to ensure that the intended reordering does not come undone because of phrase internal reordering (<REF ID="R-07" RPTR="15">Elming, 2008</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-41454">This approach was shown to produce improved MT output on English-Danish MT, a relatively closely-related and similarly-structured language pair.</S>
        <S ID="S-41455">In this paper, we study whether this approach can be extended to distant language pairs, specifically English-to-Arabic.</S>
        <S ID="S-41456">We achieve significant improvement in translation quality over related approaches, measured by manual as well as automatic evaluations on this task.</S>
        <S ID="S-41457">This proves the viability of this approach on distant languages.</S>
        <S ID="S-41458">We also examined the effect of the alignment method on learning reordering rules.</S>
        <S ID="S-41459">Interestingly, our experiments produced better translation using rules learned from automatic alignments than using rules learned from manual alignments.</S>

      <HEADER>2 Related Work</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-41465">Much work has been done in syntactic reordering for SMT, focusing on both source and targetlanguage syntax.</S>
        <S ID="S-41466">In this paper, we adapt an approach that utilizes source-syntax information as opposed to target-side syntax systems (<REF ID="R-27" RPTR="44">Yamada and Knight, 2001</REF>; <REF ID="R-08" RPTR="18">Galley et al., 2004</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-41467">This is because we are translating from English to Arabic and we are discouraged by recent results indicating Arabic parsing is not at a stage that makes it usable in MT (<REF ID="R-10" RPTR="21">Habash et al., 2006</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-41468">While several recent authors using a pre-translation (sourceside) reordering approach have achieved positive results, it has been difficult to integrate syntactic</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-41469">information while retaining the strengths of the statistical approach.</S>
        <S ID="S-41470">In some studies, reordering decisions are done &#8220;deterministically&#8221; by supplying the decoder with a canonical word order (<REF ID="R-26" RPTR="43">Xia and McCord, 2004</REF>; <REF ID="R-05" RPTR="6">Collins et al., 2005</REF>; <REF ID="R-25" RPTR="42">Wang et al., 2007</REF>; <REF ID="R-12" RPTR="23">Habash, 2007</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-41471">These reordering rules are either manually specified or automatically learned from alignments; and they are always placed outside the actual PSMT system.</S>
        <S ID="S-41472">By contrast, other studies (<REF ID="R-06" RPTR="7">Crego and Mari&#241;o, 2007</REF>; Zhang et al., 2007; <REF ID="R-20" RPTR="36">Li et al., 2007</REF>; <REF ID="R-07" RPTR="16">Elming, 2008</REF>) are more in the spirit of PSMT, in that multiple reorderings are presented to the PSMT system as (possibly weighted) options that are allowed to contribute alongside other parameters.</S>
        <S ID="S-41473">Specifically, we follow the pre-translation reordering approach of <REF ID="R-07" RPTR="10">Elming (2008)</REF>.</S>
        <S ID="S-41474">This approach has been proven to remedy shortcomings of other pre-translation reordering approaches by reordering the input word sequence, but scoring the output word sequence.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-41475"><REF ID="R-07" RPTR="11">Elming (2008)</REF> only examined the approach within English &#8211; Danish, a language pair that displays little reordering.</S>
        <S ID="S-41476">By contrast, in this paper, we target the more demanding reordering task of translating between two distant languages, English and Arabic.</S>
        <S ID="S-41477">While much work has been done on Arabic to English MT (<REF ID="R-09" RPTR="19">Habash and Sadat, 2006</REF>; <REF ID="R-19" RPTR="34">Lee, 2004</REF>) mostly focusing on addressing the problems caused by the rich morphology of Arabic, we handle the less described translation direction: English to Arabic.</S>
        <S ID="S-41478">Recently, there are some new publications on English to Arabic MT.</S>
        <S ID="S-41479"><REF ID="R-23" RPTR="40">Sarikaya and Deng (2007)</REF> use joint morphological-lexical language models to re-rank the output of English dialectal-Arabic MT, and <REF ID="R-00" RPTR="0">Badr et al. (2008)</REF> report results on the value of the morphological decomposition of Arabic during training and describe different techniques for re-composition of Arabic in the output.</S>
        <S ID="S-41480">We differ from the previous efforts targeting Arabic in that (1) we do not address morphology issues through segmentation (more on this in section 3) and (2) we focus on utilizing syntactic knowledge to address the reordering challenges of this translation direction.</S>

      <HEADER>3 Arabic Syntactic Issues</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-41481">Arabic is a morphologically and syntactically complex language with many differences from English.</S>
        <S ID="S-41482">Arabic morphology has been well studied in the context of MT.</S>
        <S ID="S-41483">Previous results all suggest that some degree of tokenization is helpful when translating from Arabic (<REF ID="R-09" RPTR="20">Habash and Sadat, 2006</REF>; <REF ID="R-19" RPTR="35">Lee, 2004</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-41484">However, when translating into a morphologically rich language, target tokenization means that the translation process is broken into multiple steps (Badr et al., 2008).</S>
        <S ID="S-41485">For our experiments, Arabic was not segmented apart from simple punctuation tokenization.</S>
        <S ID="S-41486">This low level of segmentation was maintained in order to agree with the segmentation provided in the manually aligned corpus we used to learn our rules (section 6.1).</S>
        <S ID="S-41487">We found no simple means for transferring the manual alignments to more segmented language.</S>
        <S ID="S-41488">We expect that better performance would be achieved by introducing more Arabic segmentation as reported by <REF ID="R-00" RPTR="1">Badr et al. (2008)</REF>.</S>
        <S ID="S-41489">1 As such, and unlike previous work in PSMT translating into Arabic, we focus here on syntax.</S>
        <S ID="S-41490">We plan to investigate different tokenization schemes for syntactic preprocessing in future work.</S>
        <S ID="S-41491">Next, we describe three prominent English- Arabic syntactic phenomena that have motivated some of our decisions in this paper.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-41492">First is verb-subject order.</S>
        <S ID="S-41493">Arabic verb subjects may be: (a.</S>
        <S ID="S-41494">) pro-dropped (verb conjugated), (b.</S>
        <S ID="S-41495">) pre-verbal (SVO), or (c.</S>
        <S ID="S-41496">) post-verbal (VSO).</S>
        <S ID="S-41497">Although the English SVO order is possible in Arabic, it is not always preferred, especially when the subject is particularly long.</S>
        <S ID="S-41498">Unfortunately, this is the harder case for PSMT to handle.</S>
        <S ID="S-41499">For small subject noun phrases (NP), PSMT might be able to handle the reordering in the phrase table if the verb and subject were seen in training.</S>
        <S ID="S-41500">But this becomes much less likely with very long NPs that exceed the size of the phrases in a phrase table.</S>
        <S ID="S-41501">The example in Figure 1 illustrates this point.</S>
        <S ID="S-41502">Bolding and italics are used to mark the verb and subordinating conjunction that surround the subject NP (19 tokens) in English and what they map to in Arabic, respectively.</S>
        <S ID="S-41503">2</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-41504">Secondly, Arabic adjectival modifiers typically follow their nouns with the exception of some superlative adjectives.</S>
        <S ID="S-41505">However, English adjectival modifiers can follow or precede their nouns depending on the size of the adjectival phrase: single word adjectives precede but multi-word adjectives phrases follow (or precede while hyphenated).</S>
        <S ID="S-41506">For example, a tall man translates as &#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533; &#65533;&#65533;&#65533; &#65533; rjl</S>

        <P>
          <S ID="S-41528">Table 1 contains an example of the features available to the algorithm learning reordering rules.</S>
          <S ID="S-41529">We include features for the candidate reordering sequences (LS and RS) and for their possible left (LC) and right (RC) contexts.</S>
          <S ID="S-41530">In addition to words and parts-of-speech (POS), we provide phrase structure (PS) sequences and subordination information (SUBORD).</S>
          <S ID="S-41531">The PS sequence is made up of the highest level nodes in the syntax tree that cover the words of the current sequence and only these.</S>
          <S ID="S-41532">Subordinate information can also be extracted from the syntax tree.</S>
          <S ID="S-41533">A subordinate clause is defined as inside an SBAR constituent; otherwise it is a main clause.</S>
          <S ID="S-41534">Our intuition is that all these features will allow us to learn the best rules possible to address the phenomena discussed in section 3 at the right level of generality.</S>
          <S ID="S-41535">In order to minimize the amount of training data, word and POS sequences are annotated as too long (T/L) if they are longer than 4 words, and the same for phrase structure (PS) sequences if they are longer than 3 units.</S>
          <S ID="S-41536">A feature vector is only used if at least one of these three levels is not T/L for both LS and RS, and T/L contexts are not included in the set.</S>
          <S ID="S-41537">This does not constrain the possible length of a reordering, since a PS sequence of length 1 can cover an entire sentence.</S>
          <S ID="S-41538">In the example in Table 1, LS and RS are single words, but they are not restricted in length.</S>
          <S ID="S-41539">The span of the contexts varies from a single neighboring word to all the way to the sentence border.</S>
          <S ID="S-41540">In the example, LS and RS should be reordered, since adjectives appear as post-modifiers in Arabic.</S>

          <S ID="S-41559">They can occur because of stage (1), i.e. the lattice reordering of the original English word order (phrase external reordering), and they can occur inside a single phrase (phrase internal reordering).</S>

          <S ID="S-41574">Both these scorings are performed in a phrase-independent manner.</S>
          <S ID="S-41575">The decoder assigns the reordering cost to H2 without knowing whether the reordering is internal (due to a phrase table entry) or external (due to a syntactic rule).</S>

        <P>
          <S ID="S-41576">Phrase internal reorderings at other points of the sentence, i.e. points that are not covered by a rule, are not judged by the reordering model.</S>

          <S ID="S-41578">If no rule has an opinion at a certain point in a sentence, the decoder is free to choose the phrase translation it prefers without reordering cost.</S>

          <S ID="S-41628">In addition to evaluating the reordering approaches, we also report on supplying them with different reordering rule sets: a set that was learned on manually aligned data (MAN), and a set learned on the same data but with automatic alignments (GDF).</S>

        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-41630">Pharaoh Monotone performs similarly to Pharaoh Free.</S>
          <S ID="S-41631">This shows that the question of improved reordering is not about quantity, but rather quality: what constraints are optimal to generate the best word order.</S>
          <S ID="S-41632">The TO approach gets an increase over Pharaoh Free of 1.3 and 1.6 %BLEU on the test sets, and 0.2 and 0.5 %BLEU over Pharaoh DL4.</S>
          <S ID="S-41633">Improvement is less noticeable over the other pre-translation reordering approaches (NO and SO).</S>
          <S ID="S-41634">A possible explanation is that the rules do not apply very often, in combination with the fact that the approaches often behave alike.</S>
          <S ID="S-41635">The difference in SO and TO scoring only leads to a difference in translation in &#8764;14% of the sentences.</S>
          <S ID="S-41636">This set, the diff set, is interesting, since it provides a focus on the difference between these approaches.</S>
          <S ID="S-41637">In table 4, we evaluate on this set.</S>

        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-41639">Overall the TO approach seems to be a superior reordering method.</S>
          <S ID="S-41640">To back this observation, 50 sentences of MT04 are manually evaluated by a native speaker of Arabic.</S>
          <S ID="S-41641"><REF ID="R-01" RPTR="2">Callison-Burch et al. (2007)</REF> show that ranking sentences gives higher inter-annotator agreement than scoring adequacy and fluency.</S>
          <S ID="S-41642">We therefore employ this evaluation method, asking the evaluator to rank sentences from four of the systems given the input sentence.</S>

          <S ID="S-41646">This shows the TO scoring to be significantly superior to the other methods (p &lt; 0.01 using Wilcoxon signed-rank testing).</S>

        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-41648">Another interesting observation is that reordering rules learned from automatic alignments lead to significantly better translation than rules learned from manual alignment.</S>
          <S ID="S-41649">Due to the much higher quality of the manual alignment, the opposite might be expected.</S>
          <S ID="S-41650">However, this may be just a variant on the observation that alignment improvements (measured against human references) seldom lead to MT improvements (<REF ID="R-21" RPTR="38">Lopez and Resnik, 2006</REF>).</S>
          <S ID="S-41651">The MAN alignments may in fact be better than GDF, but they are most certainly more different in nature from real alignment than the GDF alignments are.</S>
          <S ID="S-41652">As such, the MAN alignments are not as powerful as we would have liked them to be.</S>
          <S ID="S-41653">In our data sets, the GDF rules, seem less specific, and they therefore apply more frequently than the MAN rules.</S>
          <S ID="S-41654">On average, this results in more than 7 times as many possible reordering paths per sentence.</S>
          <S ID="S-41655">This means that the GDF rules supply the decoder with a larger search space, which in turn means more proposed translation hypotheses.</S>
          <S ID="S-41656">This may play a big part in the effect of the rule sets.</S>

        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-41658">Table 5 shows the reordering choices made by the approaches in decoding.</S>
          <S ID="S-41659">Most noticeable is that the SO approach is strongly biased against phrase internal reorderings; TO uses more than 30 times as many phrase internal reorderings as SO.</S>
          <S ID="S-41660">In addition, TO is less likely to reject a rule proposed reordering.</S>
          <S ID="S-41661">The 50 sentences from the manual evaluation are also manually analyzed with regards to reordering.</S>
          <S ID="S-41662">For each reordering in these sentences, the four systems are ranked according to how well the area affected by the reordering is translated.</S>
          <S ID="S-41663">This indicates that the SO approach&#8217;s bias against phrase internal reorderings may hurt performance.</S>
          <S ID="S-41664">25% of the time, when SO chooses an external reordering, while the TO approach chooses an internal reordering, the TO approach gets a better translation.</S>
          <S ID="S-41665">Only in 7% of the cases is it the other way around.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-41666">Another discovery from the analysis is when TO chooses an internal reordering and NO rejects the reordering.</S>
          <S ID="S-41667">Here, TO leads to a better translation 45% of the time, while NO never outperforms TO.</S>
          <S ID="S-41668">In these cases, either approach has used a phrase to cover the area, but via rule-based motivation, TO has forced a less likely phrase with the correct word order through.</S>
          <S ID="S-41669">This clearly shows that local reordering is not handled sufficiently by phrase internal reordering alone.</S>
          <S ID="S-41670">These need to be controlled too.</S>

          <S ID="S-41677">The SBAR condition may help restrict the reordering to finite verbs of the main clause.</S>
          <S ID="S-41678">This rule and its probability goes well with the description given in sections 3, since VSO order is not obligatory.</S>
          <S ID="S-41679">The subject may be unexpressed, or it may appear in front of the verb.</S>

          <S ID="S-41694">The left context restrictions server the same purpose as the left context in rule 1; these should often be moved together with the singular noun.</S>
          <S ID="S-41695">The function of the right context is harder to explain, but without this restriction, the rule would have been much less successful; dropping from a probability of 71% to 51%.</S>
          <S ID="S-41696">An overall comparison of the rules produced based on the manual and automatic alignments shows no major difference in quality.</S>
          <S ID="S-41697">This is especially interesting in light of the better translation using the GDF rules.</S>
          <S ID="S-41698">It is also very interesting that it seems possible to get as good rules from the GDF as from the MAN alignments.</S>
          <S ID="S-41699">This is a new result compared to <REF ID="R-07" RPTR="14">Elming (2008)</REF>, where results on manual alignments only are reported.</S>

      <HEADER>7 Conclusion and Future Plans</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-41701">We have explored the syntactic reordering approach previously presented in (<REF ID="R-07" RPTR="17">Elming, 2008</REF>) within a more distant language pair, English- Arabic.</S>
        <S ID="S-41702">A translation direction that is highly under-represented in MT research, compared to the opposite direction.</S>
        <S ID="S-41703">We achieve significant improvement in translation quality over related approaches, measured by manual as well as automatic evaluations on this task.</S>
        <S ID="S-41704">Thus proving the viability of the approach on distant languages.</S>
        <S ID="S-41705">We also examined the effect of the alignment method on learning reordering rules.</S>
        <S ID="S-41706">Interestingly, our experiments produced better translation using rules learned from automatic alignments than using rules learned from manual alignments.</S>
        <S ID="S-41707">This is an aspect we want to explore further in the future.</S>
        <S ID="S-41708">In future work, we would also like to address the morphological complexity of Arabic together with syntax.</S>
        <S ID="S-41709">We plan to consider different segmentations for Arabic and study their interaction with translation and syntactic reordering.</S>
        <S ID="S-41710">An important aspect of the TO approach is that it uses phrase internal alignments during translation.</S>
        <S ID="S-41711">In the future, we wish to examine the effect their quality has on translation.</S>
        <S ID="S-41712">We are also interested in examining the approach within a standard phrase-based decoder such as Moses (<REF ID="R-15" RPTR="28">Koehn et al., 2003</REF><REF ID="R-16" RPTR="31">Koehn et al., 2003</REF>b) or a hierarchical phrase system (<REF ID="R-03" RPTR="5">Chiang, 2005</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-41713">The idea of training on reordered source language is often connected with pre-translation reordering.</S>
        <S ID="S-41714">The present approach does not employ this strategy, since this is no trivial matter in a non-deterministic, weighted approach.</S>
        <S ID="S-41715">Zhang et al. (2007) proposed an approach that builds on unfolding alignments.</S>
        <S ID="S-41716">This is not an optimal solution, since this may not reflect their rules.</S>
        <S ID="S-41717">Training on both original and reordered data may strengthen the approach, but it would not remedy the problems of the SO approach, since it would still be ignorant of the internal reorderings of a phrase.</S>
        <S ID="S-41718">Nevertheless, it may strengthen the TO approach even further.</S>
        <S ID="S-41719">We also wish to examine this in future work.</S>
