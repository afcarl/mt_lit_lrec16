  <ABSTRACT>
    <A-S ID="S-45813">Cross lingual information access (CLIA) systems are required to access the large amounts of multilingual content generated on the world wide web in the form of blogs, news articles and documents.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-45814">In this paper, we discuss our approach to query formation for CLIA systems where language resources are replaced by Wikipedia.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-45815">We claim that Wikipedia, with its rich multilingual content and structure, forms an ideal platform to build a CLIA system.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-45816">Our approach is particularly useful for under-resourced languages, as all the languages don&#8217;t have the resources(tools) with sufficient accuracies.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-45817">We propose a context aware language-independent query formation method which, with the help of bilingual dictionaries, forms queries in the target language.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-45818">Results are encouraging with a precision of 69.75% and thus endorse our claim on using Wikipedia for building CLIA systems.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-45819">are in need.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-45820">Language independent approach is particularly useful for languages that fall into the category of under-resourced (African, few Asian languages), that doesn&#8217;t have sufficient resources.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-45821">In our approach towards language-independent CLIA system, we have developed context aware query translation using Wikipedia.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-45822">Due to voluntary contribution of millions of users, Wikipedia gathers very significant amount of updated knowledge and provides a structured way to access it.</A-S>

        <S ID="S-45823">Cross lingual information access (CLIA) systems enable users to access the rich multilingual content that is created on the web daily.</S>
        <S ID="S-45824">Such systems are vital to bridge the gap between information available and languages known to the user.</S>
        <S ID="S-45825">Considerable amount of research has been done on building such systems but most of them rely heavily on the language resources and tools developed.</S>
        <S ID="S-45826">With a constant increase in the number of languages around the world with their content on the web, CLIA systems Figure 1: Number of Wikipedia pages(Y-axis) with and without Inter language link (ILL) to English in each language (X-axis)</S>

      <P>
        <S ID="S-45827">The statistics in the Figure 1 show that it has rich multilingual content and is growing independent of the presence of English counter part.</S>
        <S ID="S-45828">With its structurally rich content, it provides an ideal platform to perform cross lingual research.</S>
        <S ID="S-45829">We harness Wikipedia and its structure to replace the language specific resources required for CLIA.</S>

        <S ID="S-45835">We have constructed a bilingual dictionary using cross lingual links present across the articles of same topic in different languages.</S>
        <S ID="S-45836">As each word in the dictionary can have several translations based on various attributes like context, sense etc, we need a mechanism to identify the target word accurately based on the context of the query.</S>
        <S ID="S-45837">To identify the context of a query, &#8220;Content Words&#8221;, that are built for each Wikipedia article, are used.</S>
        <S ID="S-45838">&#8220;Content Words&#8221; of the article are similar to the tags of the article, that reflects the context of the article in a more detailed way.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-45839">In this paper, we detail our approach in forming this &#8220;Content Words&#8221; and using them to form the query.</S>
        <S ID="S-45840">Since our approach is language-independent and context-aware, we used a metric proposed by (<REF ID="R-00" RPTR="0">Bharadwaj and Varma, 2011</REF>) to evaluate along with a dicationary-based metric.</S>
        <S ID="S-45841">The system is built between languages English and Hindi.</S>
        <S ID="S-45842">Hindi is selected as target language because of the availability of resources for evaluation.</S>
        <S ID="S-45843">As our approach is language-independent, it can be used to translate queries between any pair of languages present in Wikipedia.</S>

      <P>
        <S ID="S-45852">Dictionary building can be broadly classified into two approaches, manual and automatic.</S>
        <S ID="S-45853">At initial stages, various projects like (<REF ID="R-01" RPTR="3">Breen, 2004</REF>) try to build dictionaries manually, taking lot of time and effort.</S>
        <S ID="S-45854">Though manual approaches perform well, they lag behind when recent vocabulary is considered.</S>
        <S ID="S-45855">To reduce the effort involved, automatic extraction of dictionaries has been envisioned.</S>
        <S ID="S-45856">The approach followed by (<REF ID="R-07" RPTR="9">Kay and Roscheisen, 1999</REF>) and (<REF ID="R-02" RPTR="4">Brown et al., 1990</REF>) were towards statistical machine translation, that can also be applied to dictionary building.</S>
        <S ID="S-45857">The major requirement for using statistical methods is the availability of bilingual parallel corpora, that again is limited for underresourced languages.</S>
        <S ID="S-45858">Factors like sentence structure, grammatical differences, availability of language resources and the amount of parallel corpus available further hamper the recall and coverage of the dictionaries extracted.</S>
        <S ID="S-45859">After parallel corpora, attempts have been made to construct bilingual dictionaries using various types of corpora like comparable corpus (<REF ID="R-08" RPTR="10">Sadat et al., 2003</REF>) and noisy parallel corpus (<REF ID="R-05" RPTR="7">Fung and McKeown, 1997</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-45860">Though there exist various approaches, most of them make use of the language resources.</S>
        <S ID="S-45861">Wikipedia has also been used to mine dictionaries.</S>
        <S ID="S-45862">(Tyers and Pienaar, 2008), (<REF ID="R-03" RPTR="5">Erdmann et al., 2008</REF>), (<REF ID="R-04" RPTR="6">Erdmann et al., 2009</REF>) have built bilingual dictionaries using Wikipedia and language resources.</S>
        <S ID="S-45863">We have mined our dictionaries similarly considering the cross lingual links present.</S>
        <S ID="S-45864">Our approach to dictionary building is detailed in section 3.</S>
        <S ID="S-45865">Wikipedia has been used for CLIA at various stages including query formation.</S>
        <S ID="S-45866">Most recently, Wikipedia structure has been exploited in (<REF ID="R-06" RPTR="8">Gaillard et al., 2010</REF>) for query translation and disambiguation.</S>
        <S ID="S-45867">In (<REF ID="R-09" RPTR="11">Sch&#246;nhofen et al., 2008</REF>), Wikipedia has been exploited at all the stages of building a CLIA system.</S>
        <S ID="S-45868">We tread the same path of (<REF ID="R-09" RPTR="12">Sch&#246;nhofen et al., 2008</REF>) in harnessing Wikipedia for dictionary building and query formation.</S>
        <S ID="S-45869">Similar to them we extract concept words for each Wikipedia article and use them to disambiguate and form the query.</S>
        <S ID="S-45870">For evaluation purposes, we adapted evaluation measures based on Wikipedia and existing dictionaries (<REF ID="R-00" RPTR="1">Bharadwaj and Varma, 2011</REF>).</S>

        <S ID="S-45873">We adopt a similar classification based technique and build feature vectors for classification using Support Vector Machines (SVM 1 ) for evaluation.</S>

        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-45965">&#8226; Dictionary (Shabdanjali) doesn&#8217;t contain words of the query.</S>
          <S ID="S-45966">(Coverage is less).</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-45967">&#8226; Word forms present in the dictionary are different to that of words present in translated query.</S>
          <S ID="S-45968">(Ex: spelling, tense etc).</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-45969">To negate the effect of above factors, classification based evaluation ( 4.1.2) has been considered.</S>
          <S ID="S-45970">Classification based evaluation shows that the results are better when the entire sentence and its context is considered.</S>
          <S ID="S-45971">As there are no existing systems that translate queries based on the context and language independent, our results are encouraging to work in this direction.</S>
          <S ID="S-45972">Since no language resources were used, our approach is scalable and can be applied to any pair of languages present in Wikipedia.</S>
          <S ID="S-45973">The relatively low coverage of the dictionaries built using Wikipedia structure also affects the process of query translation.</S>
          <S ID="S-45974">In future, the coverage of dictionaries can also be increased by considering other structural properties of Wikipedia.</S>

      <HEADER>5 Conclusion</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-45976">In this paper, we have described our approach towards building a language-independent context aware query translation, replacing the language resources with the rich multilingual content provider, Wikipedia.</S>
        <S ID="S-45977">Its structural aspects have been exploited to build the dictionary and its articles are used to form queries and also to evaluate them.</S>
        <S ID="S-45978">Further exploitation of Wikipedia and its structure to increase the coverage of the dictionaries built will increase the overall precision.</S>
        <S ID="S-45979">Though queries are translated in a language-independent way, using language resources of English, as it is a richly resourced language, for query formation is also envisioned.</S>
