        <S ID="S-21880">Alignment modelling for Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) is the task of determining translational correspondences between the words in pairs of sentences in parallel text.</S>
        <S ID="S-21881">Given a source language word sequence f1 J and a target language word sequence e I 1 , we model the translation probability as P(e I 1|f1 J ) and introduce a hidden variable a I 1 representing a mapping from the target word positions to source word positions such that e i is aligned to f ai .</S>
        <S ID="S-21882">Then P(e I 1|f j 1 ) = &#8721; a P(e I 1, a I 1|f j I 1 ) (Brown et al.,</S>

        <S ID="S-21884">Previous work on statistical alignment modelling has not taken into account the source word context when determining translations of that word.</S>
        <S ID="S-21885">It is intuitive that a word in one context, with a particular part-of-speech and particular words surrounding it, may translate differently when in a different context.</S>
        <S ID="S-21886">We aim to take advantage of this information to provide a better estimate of the word&#8217;s translation.</S>
        <S ID="S-21887">The challenge of incorporating context information is maintaining computational tractability of estimation and alignment, and we develop algorithms to overcome this.</S>

          <S ID="S-21736">We go on to develop a context-dependent HMM model for alignment.</S>

          <S ID="S-21738">We perform morphological decomposition of the Arabic text using MADA, and use part-of-speech taggers on both languages.</S>

      <HEADER>5 Conclusions and future work</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-22061">We have introduced context-dependent Model 1 and HMM alignment models, which use context information in the source language to improve estimates of wordto-word translation probabilities.</S>
        <S ID="S-22062">Estimation of parameters using these contexts without smoothing leads to data sparsity problems; therefore we have developed decision tree clustering algorithms to cluster source word contexts based on optimisation of the EM auxiliary function.</S>
        <S ID="S-22063">Context information is incorporated by the use of part-ofspeech tags in both languages of the parallel text, and the EM algorithm is used for parameter estimation.</S>
        <S ID="S-22064">We have shown that these improvements to the model lead to decreased AER compared to context-independent models.</S>
        <S ID="S-22065">Finally, we compare machine translation systems built using our context-dependent alignments.</S>
        <S ID="S-22066">For both Arabic- and Chinese-to-English translation, we report an increase in translation quality measured by BLEU score compared to a system built using contextindependent alignments.</S>
        <S ID="S-22067">This paper describes an initial investigation into context-sensitive alignment models, and there are many possible directions for future research.</S>
        <S ID="S-22068">Clustering the probability distributions of infrequently occurring may produce improvements in alignment quality, different model training schemes and extensions of the contextdependence to more sophisticated alignment models will be investigated.</S>
        <S ID="S-22069">Further translation experiments will be carried out.</S>
