      <P>
        <S ID="S-35022">Statistical machine translation (SMT) systems require large parallel corpora in order to be able to obtain a reasonable translation quality.</S>
        <S ID="S-35023">In statistical learning theory, it is assumed that the training and test datasets are drawn from the same distribution, or in other words, they are from the same domain.</S>
        <S ID="S-35024">However, bilingual corpora are only available in very limited domains and building bilingual resources in a new domain is usually very expensive.</S>
        <S ID="S-35025">It is an interesting question whether a model that is trained on an existing large bilingual corpus in a specific domain can be adapted to another domain for which little parallel data is present.</S>
        <S ID="S-35026">Domain adaptation techniques aim at finding ways to adjust an out-of-domain (OUT) model to represent a target domain (in-domain or IN).</S>
        <S ID="S-35027">Common techniques for model adaptation adapt two main components of contemporary state-of-theart SMT systems: the language model and the translation model.</S>
        <S ID="S-35028">However, language model adaptation is a more straight-forward problem compared to translation model adaptation, because various measures such as perplexity of adapted language models can be easily computed on data in the target domain.</S>
        <S ID="S-35029">As a result, language model adaptation has been well studied in various work (Clarkson and Robinson, 1997; Seymore and Rosenfeld, 1997; Bacchiani and Roark, 2003; Eck et al., 2004) both for speech recognition and for machine translation.</S>
        <S ID="S-35030">It is also easier to obtain monolingual data in the target domain, compared to bilingual data which is required for translation model adaptation.</S>
        <S ID="S-35031">In this paper, we focused on adapting only the translation model by fixing a language model for all the experiments.</S>
        <S ID="S-35032">We expect domain adaptation for machine translation can be improved further by combining orthogonal techniques for translation model adaptation combined with language model adaptation.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-35033">In this paper, a new approach for adapting the translation model is proposed.</S>
        <S ID="S-35034">We use a novel system combination approach called ensemble decoding in order to combine two or more translation models with the goal of constructing a system that outperforms all the component models.</S>
        <S ID="S-35035">The strength of this system combination method is that the systems are combined in the decoder.</S>
        <S ID="S-35036">This enables the decoder to pick the best hypotheses for each span of the input.</S>
        <S ID="S-35037">The main applications of ensemble models are domain adaptation, domain mixing and system combination.</S>
        <S ID="S-35038">We have modified Kriya (Sankaran et al., 2012), an in-house implementation of hierarchical phrase-based translation system (Chiang, 2005), to implement ensemble decoding using multiple translation models.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-35039">We compare the results of ensemble decoding with a number of baselines for domain adaptation.</S>
        <S ID="S-35040">In addition to the basic approach of concatenation of in-domain and out-of-domain data, we also trained a log-linear mixture model (Foster and Kuhn, 2007)</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-35041">as well as the linear mixture model of (Foster et al., 2010) for conditional phrase-pair probabilities over IN and OUT.</S>
        <S ID="S-35042">Furthermore, within the framework of ensemble decoding, we study and evaluate various methods for combining translation tables.</S>

      <HEADER>2 Baselines</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-35063">The natural baseline for model adaption is to concatenate the IN and OUT data into a single parallel corpus and train a model on it.</S>
        <S ID="S-35064">In addition to this baseline, we have experimented with two more sophisticated baselines which are based on mixture techniques.</S>

        <HEADER>2.1 Log-Linear Mixture</HEADER>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-35043">Log-linear translation model (TM) mixtures are of the form: ( p(&#275;| &#175;f) &#8721; M ) &#8733; exp &#955; m log p m (&#275;| &#175;f)</S>

        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-35045">where m ranges over IN and OUT, p m (&#275;| &#175;f) is an estimate from a component phrase table, and each &#955; m is a weight in the top-level log-linear model, set so as to maximize dev-set BLEU using minimum error rate training (Och, 2003).</S>
          <S ID="S-35046">We learn separate weights for relative-frequency and lexical estimates for both p m (&#275;| &#175;f) and p m ( &#175;f|&#275;).</S>
          <S ID="S-35047">Thus, for 2 component models (from IN and OUT training corpora), there are 4 &#8727; 2 = 8 TM weights to tune.</S>
          <S ID="S-35048">Whenever a phrase pair does not appear in a component phrase table, we set the corresponding p m (&#275;| &#175;f) to a small epsilon value.</S>

      <HEADER>3 Ensemble Decoding</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-35125">Ensemble decoding is a way to combine the expertise of different models in one single model.</S>
        <S ID="S-35126">The current implementation is able to combine hierarchical phrase-based systems (Chiang, 2005) as well as phrase-based translation systems (Koehn et al., 2003).</S>
        <S ID="S-35127">However, the method can be easily extended to support combining a number of heterogeneous translation systems e.g. phrase-based, hierarchical phrase-based, and/or syntax-based systems.</S>
        <S ID="S-35128">This section explains how such models can be combined during the decoding.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-35129">Given a number of translation models which are already trained and tuned, the ensemble decoder uses hypotheses constructed from all of the models in order to translate a sentence.</S>
        <S ID="S-35130">We use the bottomup CKY parsing algorithm for decoding.</S>
        <S ID="S-35131">For each sentence, a CKY chart is constructed.</S>
        <S ID="S-35132">The cells of the CKY chart are populated with appropriate rules from all the phrase tables of different components.</S>
        <S ID="S-35133">As in the Hiero SMT system (Chiang, 2005), the cells which span up to a certain length (i.e. the maximum span length) are populated from the phrasetables and the rest of the chart uses glue rules as defined in (Chiang, 2005).</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-35134">The rules suggested from the component models are combined in a single set.</S>
        <S ID="S-35135">Some of the rules may be unique and others may be common with other component model rule sets, though with different scores.</S>

        <P>
          <S ID="S-35111">Since in log-linear models, the model scores are not normalized to form probability distributions, the scores that different models assign to each phrasepair may not be in the same scale.</S>
          <S ID="S-35112">Therefore, mixing their scores might wash out the information in one (or some) of the models.</S>
          <S ID="S-35113">We experimented with two different ways to deal with this normalization issue.</S>
          <S ID="S-35114">A practical but inexact heuristic is to normalize the scores over a shorter list.</S>
          <S ID="S-35115">So the list of rules coming from each model for a cell in CKY chart is normalized before getting mixed with other phrase-table rules.</S>
          <S ID="S-35116">However, experiments showed changing the scores with the normalized scores hurts the BLEU score radically.</S>
          <S ID="S-35117">So we use the normalized scores only for pruning and the actual scores are intact.</S>
          <S ID="S-35118">We could also globally normalize the scores to obtain posterior probabilities using the inside-outside algorithm.</S>
          <S ID="S-35119">However, we did not try it as the BLEU scores we got using the normalization heuristic was not promissing and it would impose a cost in decoding as well.</S>

          <S ID="S-35191">Early approaches to domain adaptation involved information retrieval techniques where sentence pairs related to the target domain were retrieved from the training corpus using IR methods (Eck et al., 2004; Hildebrand et al., 2005).</S>

          <S ID="S-35194">These sentences are used to enrich the IN training set.</S>
          <S ID="S-35195">Other domain adaptation methods involve techniques that distinguish between general and domainspecific examples (Daum&#233; and Marcu, 2006).</S>

          <S ID="S-35197">This approach tries to penalize misleading training instances from OUT and assign more weight to IN-like instances than OUT instances.</S>
          <S ID="S-35198">Foster et al. (2010) propose a similar method for machine translation that uses features to capture degrees of generality.</S>
          <S ID="S-35199">Particularly, they include the output from an SVM classifier that uses the intersection between IN and OUT as positive examples.</S>
          <S ID="S-35200">Unlike previous work on instance weighting in machine translation, they use phraselevel instances instead of sentences.</S>

        <P>
          <S ID="S-35227">Tackling the model adaptation problem using system combination approaches has been experimented in various work (Koehn and Schroeder, 2007; Hildebrand and Vogel, 2009).</S>
          <S ID="S-35228">Among these approaches are sentence-based, phrase-based and word-based output combination methods.</S>
          <S ID="S-35229">In a similar approach, Koehn and Schroeder (2007) use a feature of the factored translation model framework in Moses SMT system (Koehn and Schroeder, 2007) to use multiple alternative decoding paths.</S>
          <S ID="S-35230">Two decoding paths, one for each translation table (IN and OUT), were used during decoding.</S>
          <S ID="S-35231">The weights are set with minimum error rate training (Och, 2003).</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-35232">Our work is closely related to Koehn and Schroeder (2007) but uses a different approach to deal with multiple translation tables.</S>
          <S ID="S-35233">The Moses SMT system implements (Koehn and Schroeder, 2007) and can treat multiple translation tables in two different ways: intersection and union.</S>
          <S ID="S-35234">In intersection, for each span only the hypotheses would be used that are present in all phrase tables.</S>
          <S ID="S-35235">For each set of hypothesis with the same source and target phrases, a new hypothesis is created whose feature-set is the union of feature sets of all corresponding hypotheses.</S>
          <S ID="S-35236">Union, on the other hand, uses hypotheses from all the phrase tables.</S>
          <S ID="S-35237">The feature set of these hypotheses are expanded to include one feature set for each table.</S>
          <S ID="S-35238">However, for the corresponding feature values of those phrase-tables that did not have a particular phrase-pair, a default log probability value of 0 is assumed (Bertoldi and Federico, 2009) which is counter-intuitive as it boosts the score of hypotheses with phrase-pairs that do not belong to all of the translation tables.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-35239">Our approach is different from Koehn and Schroeder (2007) in a number of ways.</S>
          <S ID="S-35240">Firstly, unlike the multi-table support of Moses which only supports phrase-based translation table combination, our approach supports ensembles of both hierarchical and phrase-based systems.</S>
          <S ID="S-35241">With little modification, it can also support ensemble of syntax-based systems with the other two state-of-the-art SMT sys-</S>

        <P>
          <S ID="S-35242">tems.</S>
          <S ID="S-35243">Secondly, our combining method uses the union option, but instead of preserving the features of all phrase-tables, it only combines their scores using various mixture operations.</S>
          <S ID="S-35244">This enables us to experiment with a number of different operations as opposed to sticking to only one combination method.</S>
          <S ID="S-35245">Finally, by avoiding increasing the number of features we can add as many translation models as we need without serious performance drop.</S>
          <S ID="S-35246">In addition, MERT would not be an appropriate optimizer when the number of features increases a certain amount (Chiang et al., 2008).</S>
          <S ID="S-35247">Our approach differs from the model combination approach of DeNero et al. (2010), a generalization of consensus or minimum Bayes risk decoding where the search space consists of those of multiple systems, in that model combination uses forest of derivations of all component models to do the combination.</S>
          <S ID="S-35248">In other words, it requires all component models to fully decode each sentence, compute n-gram expectations from each component model and calculate posterior probabilities over translation derivations.</S>
          <S ID="S-35249">While, in our approach we only use partial hypotheses from component models and the derivation forest is constructed by the ensemble model.</S>
          <S ID="S-35250">A major difference is that in the model combination approach the component search spaces are conjoined and they are not intermingled as opposed to our approach where these search spaces are intermixed on spans.</S>
          <S ID="S-35251">This enables us to generate new sentences that cannot be generated by component models.</S>
          <S ID="S-35252">Furthermore, various combination methods can be explored in our approach.</S>
          <S ID="S-35253">Finally, main techniques used in this work are orthogonal to our approach such as Minimum Bayes Risk decoding, using n-gram features and tuning using MERT.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-35254">Finally, our work is most similar to that of Liu et al. (2009) where max-derivation and maxtranslation decoding have been used.</S>
          <S ID="S-35255">Maxderivation finds a derivation with highest score and max-translation finds the highest scoring translation by summing the score of all derivations with the same yield.</S>
          <S ID="S-35256">The combination can be done in two levels: translation-level and derivation-level.</S>
          <S ID="S-35257">Their derivation-level max-translation decoding is similar to our ensemble decoding with wsum as the mixture operation.</S>
          <S ID="S-35258">We did not restrict ourself to this particular mixture operation and experimented with a number of different mixing techniques and as Table 3 shows we could improve over wsum in our experimental setup.</S>
          <S ID="S-35259">Liu et al. (2009) used a modified version of MERT to tune max-translation decoding weights, while we use a two-step approach using MERT for tuning each component model separately and then using CONDOR to tune component weights on top of them.</S>

      <P>
        <S ID="S-35261">In this paper, we presented a new approach for domain adaptation using ensemble decoding.</S>
        <S ID="S-35262">In this approach a number of MT systems are combined at decoding time in order to form an ensemble model.</S>
        <S ID="S-35263">The model combination can be done using various mixture operations.</S>
        <S ID="S-35264">We showed that this approach can gain up to 2.2 BLEU points over its concatenation baseline and 0.39 BLEU points over a powerful mixture model.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-35265">Future work includes extending this approach to use multiple translation models with multiple language models in ensemble decoding.</S>
        <S ID="S-35266">Different mixture operations can be investigated and the behaviour of each operation can be studied in more details.</S>
        <S ID="S-35267">We will also add capability of supporting syntax-based ensemble decoding and experiment how a phrase-based system can benefit from syntax information present in a syntax-aware MT system.</S>
        <S ID="S-35268">Furthermore, ensemble decoding can be applied on domain mixing settings in which development sets and test sets include sentences from different domains and genres, and this is a very suitable setting for an ensemble model which can adapt to new domains at test time.</S>
        <S ID="S-35269">In addition, we can extend our approach by applying some of the techniques used in other system combination approaches such as consensus decoding, using n-gram features, tuning using forest-based MERT, among other possible extensions.</S>
