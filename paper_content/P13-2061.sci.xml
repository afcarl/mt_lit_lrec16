        <S ID="S-38085">Statistical machine translation (SMT) depends on the amount of bilingual data and its quality.</S>
        <S ID="S-38086">In real-world SMT systems, bilingual data is often mined from the web where low-quality data is inevitable.</S>
        <S ID="S-38087">The low-quality bilingual data degrades the quality of word alignment and leads to the incorrect phrase pairs, which will hurt the translation performance of phrase-based SMT systems (<REF ID="R-05" RPTR="8">Koehn et al., 2003</REF>; <REF ID="R-10" RPTR="15">Och and Ney, 2004</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-38088">Therefore, it is very important to exploit data quality information to improve the translation modeling.</S>

        <S ID="S-38093">Smith, 2003; <REF ID="R-14" RPTR="18">Shi et al., 2006</REF>; <REF ID="R-08" RPTR="13">Munteanu and Marcu, 2005</REF>; <REF ID="R-04" RPTR="6">Jiang et al., 2009</REF>) have a postprocessing step for data cleaning.</S>
        <S ID="S-38094">Maximum entropy or SVM based classifiers are built to filter some non-parallel data or partial-parallel data.</S>
        <S ID="S-38095">Although these methods can filter some low-quality bilingual data, they need sufficient human labeled training instances to build the model, which may not be easy to acquire.</S>
        <S ID="S-38096">To this end, we propose an unsupervised approach to clean the bilingual data.</S>
        <S ID="S-38097">It is intuitive that high-quality parallel data tends to produce better phrase pairs than low-quality data.</S>
        <S ID="S-38098">Meanwhile, it is also observed that the phrase pairs that appear frequently in the bilingual corpus are more reliable than less frequent ones because they are more reusable, hence most good sentence pairs are prone to contain more frequent phrase pairs (<REF ID="R-02" RPTR="3">Foster et al., 2006</REF>; <REF ID="R-17" RPTR="22">Wuebker et al., 2010</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-38099">This kind of mutual reinforcement fits well into the framework of graph-based random walk.</S>
        <S ID="S-38100">When a phrase pair p is extracted from a sentence pair s, s is considered casting a vote for p.</S>
        <S ID="S-38101">The higher the number of votes a phrase pair has, the more reliable of the phrase pair.</S>
        <S ID="S-38102">Similarly, the quality of the sentence pair s is determined by the number of votes casted by the extracted phrase pairs from s.</S>

      <P>
        <S ID="S-38103">In this paper, a PageRank-style random walk algorithm (<REF ID="R-00" RPTR="0">Brin and Page, 1998</REF>; <REF ID="R-07" RPTR="11">Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004</REF>; <REF ID="R-15" RPTR="19">Wan et al., 2007</REF>) is conducted to iteratively compute the importance score of each sentence pair that indicates its quality: the higher the better.</S>
        <S ID="S-38104">Unlike other data filtering methods, our proposed method utilizes the importance scores of sentence pairs as fractional counts to calculate the phrase translation probabilities based on Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), thereby none of the bilingual data is filtered out.</S>
        <S ID="S-38105">Experimental results show that our proposed approach substantially improves the performance in large-scale Chinese-to-English translation tasks.</S>

          <S ID="S-38109">Depending on different scenarios, the graph can take directed or undirected, weighted or un-weighted forms.</S>
          <S ID="S-38110">Starting from the initial scores assigned in the graph, the algorithm is applied to recursively compute the importance scores of vertices until it converges, or the difference between two consecutive iterations falls below a pre-defined threshold.</S>

          <S ID="S-38231">We evaluate the proposed bilingual data cleaning method by incorporating sentence scores into translation modeling.</S>
          <S ID="S-38232">In addition, we also compare with several settings that filtering low-quality sentence pairs from the bilingual data based on the importance scores.</S>
          <S ID="S-38233">The last N = { 0.25M, 0.5M, 1M } sentence pairs are filtered before the modeling process.</S>
          <S ID="S-38234">Although the simple bilingual data filtering can improve the performance on some datasets, it is difficult to determine the border line and translation performance is fluctuated.</S>
          <S ID="S-38235">One main reason is in the proposed random walk approach, the bilingual sentence pairs with nonliteral translations may get lower scores because they appear less frequently compared with those literal translations.</S>
          <S ID="S-38236">Crudely filtering out these data may degrade the translation performance.</S>
          <S ID="S-38237">For example, we have a sentence pair in the bilingual corpus shown in the left part of Figure 2.</S>
          <S ID="S-38238">Although the translation is correct in this situation, translating the Chinese word &#8221;lingyu&#8221; to &#8221;waters&#8221; appears very few times since the common translations are &#8221;areas&#8221; or &#8221;fields&#8221;.</S>
          <S ID="S-38239">However, simply filtering out this kind of sentence pairs may lead to some loss of native English expressions, thereby the trans-</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-38240">lation performance is unstable since both nonparallel sentence pairs and non-literal but parallel sentence pairs are filtered.</S>
          <S ID="S-38241">Therefore, we use the importance score of each sentence pair to estimate the phrase translation probabilities.</S>
          <S ID="S-38242">It consistently brings substantial improvements compared to the baseline, which demonstrates graph-based random walk indeed improves the translation modeling performance for our SMT system.</S>

        <HEADER>3.4 Discussion</HEADER>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-38243">In (<REF ID="R-03" RPTR="5">Goutte et al., 2012</REF>), they evaluated phrasebased SMT systems trained on parallel data with different proportions of synthetic noisy data.</S>
          <S ID="S-38244">They suggested that when collecting larger, noisy parallel data for training phrase-based SMT, cleaning up by trying to detect and remove incorrect alignments can actually degrade performance.</S>
          <S ID="S-38245">Our experimental results confirm their findings on some datasets.</S>
          <S ID="S-38246">Based on our method, sometimes filtering noisy data leads to unexpected results.</S>
          <S ID="S-38247">The reason is two-fold: on the one hand, the non-literal parallel data makes false positive in noisy data detection; on the other hand, large-scale SMT systems is relatively robust and tolerant to noisy data, especially when we remove frequency- 1 phrase pairs.</S>
          <S ID="S-38248">Therefore, we propose to integrate the importance scores when re-estimating phrase pair probabilities in this paper.</S>
          <S ID="S-38249">The importance scores can be considered as a kind of contribution constraint, thereby high-quality parallel data contributes more while noisy parallel data contributes less.</S>

      <P>
        <S ID="S-38251">In this paper, we develop an effective approach to clean the bilingual data using graph-based random walk.</S>
        <S ID="S-38252">Significant improvements on several datasets are achieved in our experiments.</S>
        <S ID="S-38253">For future work, we will extend our method to explore the relationships of sentence-to-sentence and phrase-to-phrase, which is beyond the existing sentence-to-phrase mutual reinforcement.</S>
