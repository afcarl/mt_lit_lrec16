  <ABSTRACT>
    <A-S ID="S-22215">In current phrase-based SMT systems, more training data is generally better than less.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-22216">However, a larger data set eventually introduces a larger model that enlarges the search space for the translation problem, and consequently requires more time and more resources to translate.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-22217">We argue redundant information in a SMT system may not only delay the computations but also affect the quality of the outputs.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-22218">This paper proposes an approach to reduce the model size by filtering out the less probable entries based on compatible data in an intermediate language, a novel use of triangulation, without sacrificing the translation quality.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-22219">Comprehensive experiments were conducted on standard data sets.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-22220">We achieved significant quality improvements (up to 2.3 BLEU points) while translating with reduced models.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-22221">In addition, we demonstrate a straightforward combination method for more progressive filtering.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-22222">The reduction of the model size can be up to 94% with the translation quality being preserved.</A-S>

      <HEADER>1 Introduction</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-22223">Statistical machine translation (SMT) applies machine learning techniques to a bilingual corpus to produce a translation system entirely automatically.</S>
        <S ID="S-22224">Such a scheme has many potential advantages over earlier systems which relied on carefully crafted rules.</S>
        <S ID="S-22225">The most obvious is that it at dramatically reduces cost in human labor and it is able to reach many critical translation rules that are easily overlooked by human being.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-22226">SMT systems generally assemble translations by selecting phrases from a large candidate set.</S>
        <S ID="S-22227">Unsupervised learning often introduces a considerable amount of noise into this set as a result of which the selection process becomes more longer and less effective.</S>
        <S ID="S-22228">This paper provides one approach to these problems.</S>
        <S ID="S-22229">Various filtering techniques, such as (<REF ID="R-03" RPTR="3">Johnson et al., 2007</REF>) and (<REF ID="R-00" RPTR="0">Chen et al., 2008</REF>), have been applied to eliminate a large portion of the translation rules that were judged unlikely to be of value for the current translation.</S>
        <S ID="S-22230">However, these approaches were only able to improve the translation quality slightly.</S>
        <S ID="S-22231">In this paper, we describe a triangulation approach (<REF ID="R-04" RPTR="4">Kay, 1997</REF>) that incorporates multilingual data to improve system efficiency and translation quality at the same time.</S>
        <S ID="S-22232">Most of the previous triangulation approaches (<REF ID="R-08" RPTR="8">Kumar et al., 2007</REF>; <REF ID="R-01" RPTR="1">Cohn and Lapata, 2007</REF>; <REF ID="R-02" RPTR="2">Filali and Bilmes, 2005</REF>; Simard, 1999; <REF ID="R-09" RPTR="9">Och and Ney, 2001</REF>) add information obtained from a third language.</S>
        <S ID="S-22233">In other words, they work with the union of the data from the different languages.</S>
        <S ID="S-22234">In contrast, we work with the intersection of information acquired through a third language.</S>
        <S ID="S-22235">The hope is that the intersection will be more precise and more compact than the union, so that a better result will be obtained more efficiently.</S>

      <HEADER>2 Noise in a phrase-based SMT system</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-22236">The phrases in a translation model are extracted heuristically from a word alignment between the parallel texts in two languages using machine learning techniques.</S>
        <S ID="S-22237">The translation model feature values are stored in the form of a so-called phrase-table,</S>

        <S ID="S-22240">As we have said models built in this way tend to contain a contains a considerable amount of noise.</S>
        <S ID="S-22241">The phrase-table entries are far less reliable than the lexicons and grammar rules handcrafted for rule-based systems.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-22242">The main source of noise in the phrase table is errors from the word alignment process.</S>
        <S ID="S-22243">For example, many function words occur so frequently that they are incorrectly mapped to translations of many function words in the other language to which they are, in fact, unrelated.</S>
        <S ID="S-22244">On the other hand, many words remain unaligned on account of their very low frequency.</S>
        <S ID="S-22245">Another source noise comes from the phrase extraction algorithm itself.</S>
        <S ID="S-22246">The unaligned words are usually attached to aligned sequences In order to achieve longer phrase pairs.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-22247">The final selection of entries from the phrase table is based not only on the values assigned to them there, but also to values coming from the language and reordering models, so that entries that receive an initially high value may end up not being preferred.</S>

        <S ID="S-22252">is sometimes difficult for SMT systems to translate into English because it may appear in many positions of a sentence.</S>
        <S ID="S-22253">For instance, it occurs at the end of the sentence in (1).</S>
        <S ID="S-22254">The phrase pairs &#8220;ihre kinder nicht &#8594; their children are not&#8221; and &#8220;ihre kinder nicht &#8594; their children&#8221; are both likely also to appear in the phrase table and the former has greater estimated probability.</S>
        <S ID="S-22255">However, the language model would preferred the latter in this example because the sentence &#8220;They love their children are not.&#8221; is unlikely to be attested.</S>
        <S ID="S-22256">Accordingly, SMT system may therefore produce the misleading translation in (2).</S>

      </P>

        <S ID="S-22258">The system would not produce translations with the opposite meanings if the noisy entries like &#8220;ihre kinder nicht &#8594; their children&#8221; were excluded from the translation candidates.</S>
        <S ID="S-22259">Eliminating the noise should help to improve the system&#8217;s performance, for both efficiency and translation quality.</S>

      <HEADER>3 Triangulated filtering</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-22260">While direct translation and pivot translation through a bridge language presumably introduce noise, in substantially similar amounts, there is no reason to expect the noise in the two systems to correlate strongly.</S>
        <S ID="S-22261">In fact, the noise from such different sources, tends to be quite distinct, whereas the more useful information is often retained.</S>
        <S ID="S-22262">This encourages us to hope that information gathered from various sources will be more reliable overall.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-22263">Our plan is to ameliorate the noise problem by constructing a smaller phrase-table by taking the intersection of a number of sources.</S>
        <S ID="S-22264">We reason that a target phrase is will appear as a candidate translation of a given source phrase, only if it also appears as a candidate translation for some word or phrase in the bridge language mapping to the source phrase.</S>

        <S ID="S-22278">Figure 1 illustrates our triangulation approach.</S>
        <S ID="S-22279">Two bridge models are first constructed: one from the source language to the bridge language, and another from the target language to the bridge language.</S>
        <S ID="S-22280">Then, we use these two models to filter the original source-target model.</S>
        <S ID="S-22281">For each phrase pair in the original table, we try to find a common link in these bridge models to connect both phrases.</S>
        <S ID="S-22282">If such links do not exist, we remove the entry from the table.</S>
        <S ID="S-22283">The probability values in the table remain</S>

      <P>
        <S ID="S-22284">unchanged.</S>
        <S ID="S-22285">The reduced table can be used in place of the original one in the SMT system.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-22286">There are various forms of links that can be used as our evidence for the filtering process.</S>
        <S ID="S-22287">One obvious form is complete phrases in the bridge language, which means, for each phrase pair in the model to be filtered, we should look for a third phrase in the bridge language that can relate the two phrases in the pair.</S>
        <S ID="S-22288">This approach to filtering examines each phrase pair presented in the phrase-table one by one.</S>
        <S ID="S-22289">For each phrase pair, we collect the corresponding translations using the models for translation into a third language.</S>
        <S ID="S-22290">If both phrases can be mapped to some phrases in the bridge language, but to different ones, we should remove it from the model.</S>
        <S ID="S-22291">It is also possible that neither of the phrases appear in corresponding bridge models.</S>
        <S ID="S-22292">In this case, we consider the bridge models insufficient for making the filtering decision and prefer to keep the pair in the table.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-22293">The way a decoder constructs translation hypotheses is directly related to the weights for different model features in a SMT system, which are usually optimized for a given set of models with minimum error rate training (MERT) (<REF ID="R-10" RPTR="10">Och, 2003</REF>) to achieve better translation performance.</S>
        <S ID="S-22294">In other words, the weights obtained for a model do not necessarily apply to another model.</S>
        <S ID="S-22295">Since the triangulated filtering method removes a part of the model, it is important to readjust the feature weights for the reduced phrase-table.</S>

        <S ID="S-22297">We mainly investigated translations from Spanish to English.</S>
        <S ID="S-22298">There are enough structural differences in these two language to introduce some noise in the phrase table.</S>
        <S ID="S-22299">French, Portuguese, Danish, German and Finnish were used as bridge languages.</S>
        <S ID="S-22300">Portuguese is very similar to Spanish and French somewhat less so.</S>
        <S ID="S-22301">Finnish is unrelated and fairly different typologically with Danish and German occupying the middle ground.</S>

      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-22303">For the Spanish-English pair, three translation models were constructed over the same parallel corpora.</S>
        <S ID="S-22304">We acquired comparable data sets by drawing several subsets from the same corpus according to various maximal sentence lengths.</S>

        <S ID="S-22307">Table 1 lists the characteristics of the Spanish-English subsets.</S>
        <S ID="S-22308">Although the maximal sentence length in these sets is far less than that of the whole corpus (880 tokens), EP-50 already includes nearly 85% of Spanish-English sentence pairs from Europarl.</S>
        <S ID="S-22309">The translations models, both the models to be filtered and the bridge models, were generated from compatible Europarl subsets using the Moses toolkit (<REF ID="R-05" RPTR="5">Koehn et al., 2007</REF>) with the most basic configurations.</S>
        <S ID="S-22310">The feature weights for the Spanish- English translation models were optimized over a development set of 500 sentences using MERT to maximize BLEU (<REF ID="R-11" RPTR="11">Papineni et al., 2001</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-22311">The triangulated filtering algorithm was applied to each combination of a translation model and a third language.</S>
        <S ID="S-22312">The reordering models were also filtered according to the phrase-table.</S>
        <S ID="S-22313">Only those phrase pairs that appeared in the phrase-table remained in the reordering table.</S>
        <S ID="S-22314">We rerun the MERT process solely based on the remaining entries in the filtered tables.</S>
        <S ID="S-22315">Each table is used to translate a set of 2,000 sentences of test data (from the shared task of the third Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation, 2008 1 ).</S>

        <P>
          <S ID="S-22321">Often the question of machine translation is not only how to produce a good translation, but also how to produce it quickly.</S>
          <S ID="S-22322">To evaluate the system efficiency, we measured both storage space and time consumption.</S>

          <S ID="S-22325">We also highlighted the largest and the smallest reduction from each group.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-22326">All filtered models showed significant reductions in size.</S>
          <S ID="S-22327">The greatest reduction of model sizes, taking both phrase-table and reordering table into account, is nearly 11 gigabytes for filtering the largest model (EP-50) with a Finnish bridge, which leads to the maximal time saving of 939 seconds, or almost 16 minutes, for translating two thousand sentences.</S>
          <S ID="S-22328">The reduction rates from two larger models are very close to each other whereas the filtered table scaled down the most significantly on the smallest model (EP-20), which was in fact constructed over a much smaller subset of Europarl corpus, consisting of less than half of the sentences pairs in the other two Europarl subsets.</S>
          <S ID="S-22329">Compared to the larger Europarl subsets, the small data set is expected to produce more errors through training as there is much less relevant data for the machine learning algorithm to correctly extract useful information from.</S>
          <S ID="S-22330">Consequently, there are more noisy entries in this small model, and therefore more entries to be removed.</S>
          <S ID="S-22331">In addition, the filtering is done by exact matching of complete phrases, which presumably happens much less frequently even for correctly paired phrase pairs in the very limited data supplied by the smallest training set.</S>
          <S ID="S-22332">For the same reason, the distinction between different bridge languages was less clear for this small model.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-22333">Due to hardware limitation, we are not able to fit the unfiltered phrase tables completely into the memory.</S>
          <S ID="S-22334">Every table was filtered based on the given input so only a small portion of each table was loaded into memory.</S>
          <S ID="S-22335">This may diminish the difference between the original and the filtered table to a certain degree.</S>
          <S ID="S-22336">The relative time consumptionnevertheless agrees with the reduction in size: phrase tables from the smallest model showed the most reduction for both loading the models and processing the translations.</S>

          <S ID="S-22337">For loading time, we count the time it takes to start and to load the bilingual phrase-tables plus reordering tables and the monolingual language model into the memory.</S>

      <HEADER>6 Conclusions</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-22461">We highlighted one problem of the state-of-the-art SMT systems that was generally neglected: the noise in the translation models.</S>
        <S ID="S-22462">Accordingly, we proposed triangulated filtering methods to deal with this problem.</S>
        <S ID="S-22463">We used data in a third language as evidence to locate the less probable items in the translation models so as to obtain the intersection of information extracted from multilingual data.</S>
        <S ID="S-22464">Only the occurrences of complete phrases were taken into account.</S>
        <S ID="S-22465">The probability distributions of the phrases have not been considered so far.</S>
        <S ID="S-22466">Although the approach was fairly naive, our experiments showed it to be effective.</S>
        <S ID="S-22467">The approaches were applied to SMT systems built with the Moses toolkit.</S>
        <S ID="S-22468">The translation quality was improved at least 1 BLEU for all 15 cases (filtering 3 different models with 5 bridge languages).</S>
        <S ID="S-22469">The improvement can be as much as 2.25 BLEU.</S>
        <S ID="S-22470">It is also clear that the best translations were not linked to the largest translation models.</S>
        <S ID="S-22471">We also sketched a simple extension to the triangulated filtering approach to further reduce the model size, which allows us to generate reasonable results with only 1.4% of the entries from the original table.</S>
        <S ID="S-22472">The results varied for different bridge languages as well as different models.</S>
        <S ID="S-22473">For translation from Spanish to English, Finnish, the most distinctive bridge language, appeared to be a more effective intermediate language which could remove more phrase pair entries while still improving the translation quality.</S>
        <S ID="S-22474">Portuguese, the most close to the source language, always leads to a filtered model that produces the best translations.</S>
        <S ID="S-22475">The selection of bridge languages has more obvious impact on the performance of our approach when the size of the model to filter was larger.</S>
        <S ID="S-22476">The work gave one instance of the general approach described in Section 3.</S>
        <S ID="S-22477">There are several potential directions for continuing this work.</S>
        <S ID="S-22478">The most straightforward one is to use our approaches with more different languages, such as Chinese and Arabic, and incompatible corpora, for example, different segments of Europarl.</S>
        <S ID="S-22479">The main focus of such experiments should be verifying the conclusions we had in this paper.</S>
