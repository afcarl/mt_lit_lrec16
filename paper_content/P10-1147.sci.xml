      <HEADER>1 Introduction</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-30726">In the last decade, the field of statistical machine translation has shifted from generating sentences word by word to systems that recycle whole fragments of training examples, expressed as translation rules.</S>
        <S ID="S-30727">This general paradigm was first pursued using contiguous phrases (Och et al., 1999; <REF ID="R-24" RPTR="38">Koehn et al., 2003</REF>), and has since been generalized to a wide variety of hierarchical and syntactic formalisms.</S>
        <S ID="S-30728">The training stage of statistical systems focuses primarily on discovering translation rules in parallel corpora.</S>
        <S ID="S-30729">Most systems discover translation rules via a two-stage pipeline: a parallel corpus is aligned at the word level, and then a second procedure extracts fragment-level rules from word-aligned sentence pairs.</S>
        <S ID="S-30730">This paper offers a model-based alternative to phrasal rule extraction, which merges this two-stage pipeline into a single step.</S>
        <S ID="S-30731">We present a discriminative model that directly predicts which set of phrasal translation rules should be extracted from a sentence pair.</S>
        <S ID="S-30732">Our model predicts extraction sets: combinatorial objects that include the set of all overlapping phrasal translation rules consistent with an underlying word-level alignment.</S>
        <S ID="S-30733">This approach provides additional discriminative power relative to word aligners because extraction sets are scored based on the phrasal rules they contain in addition to word-to-word alignment links.</S>
        <S ID="S-30734">Moreover, the structure of our model directly reflects the purpose of alignment models in general, which is to discover translation rules.</S>
        <S ID="S-30735">We address several challenges to training and applying an extraction set model.</S>
        <S ID="S-30736">First, we would like to leverage existing word-level alignment resources.</S>
        <S ID="S-30737">To do so, we define a deterministic mapping from word alignments to extraction sets, inspired by existing extraction procedures.</S>
        <S ID="S-30738">In our mapping, possible alignment links have a precise interpretation that dictates what phrasal translation rules can be extracted from a sentence pair.</S>
        <S ID="S-30739">This mapping allows us to train with existing annotated data sets and use the predictions from word-level aligners as features in our extraction set model.</S>
        <S ID="S-30740">Second, our model solves a structured prediction problem, and the choice of loss function during training affects model performance.</S>
        <S ID="S-30741">We optimize for a phrase-level F-measure in order to focus learning on the task of predicting phrasal rules rather than word alignment links.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-30742">Third, our discriminative approach requires that we perform inference in the space of extraction sets.</S>
        <S ID="S-30743">Our model does not factor over disjoint wordto-word links or minimal phrase pairs, and so existing inference procedures do not directly apply.</S>
        <S ID="S-30744">However, we show that the dynamic program for a block ITG aligner can be augmented to score extraction sets that are indexed by underlying ITG word alignments (<REF ID="R-33" RPTR="52">Wu, 1997</REF>).</S>

          <S ID="S-30848">In both cases, the most important features come from the predictions of unsupervised models trained on large parallel corpora, which provide frequency and cooccurrence information.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-30849">To score word-to-word links, we use the posterior predictions of a jointly trained HMM alignment model (<REF ID="R-27" RPTR="45">Liang et al., 2006</REF>).</S>
          <S ID="S-30850">The remaining features include a dictionary feature, an identical word feature, an absolute position distortion feature, and features for numbers and punctuation.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-30851">To score phrasal translation rules in an extraction set, we use a mixture of feature types.</S>
          <S ID="S-30852">Extraction set models allow us to incorporate the same phrasal relative frequency statistics that drive phrase-based translation performance (<REF ID="R-24" RPTR="40">Koehn et al., 2003</REF>).</S>
          <S ID="S-30853">To implement these frequency features, we extract a phrase table from the alignment predictions of a jointly trained unsupervised HMM model using Moses (Koehn et al., 2007), and score bispans using the resulting features.</S>
          <S ID="S-30854">We also include indicator features on lexical templates for the 50 most common words in each language, as in <REF ID="R-19" RPTR="32">Haghighi et al. (2009)</REF>.</S>
          <S ID="S-30855">We include indicators for the number of words and Chinese characters in rules.</S>
          <S ID="S-30856">One useful indicator feature exploits the fact that capitalized terms in English tend to align to Chinese words with three or more characters.</S>
          <S ID="S-30857">On 1-by-n or n-by-1 phrasal rules, we include indicator features of fertility for common words.</S>
          <S ID="S-30858">3 We also include monolingual phrase features that expose useful information to the model.</S>
          <S ID="S-30859">For instance, English bigrams beginning with &#8220;the&#8221; are often extractable phrases.</S>
          <S ID="S-30860">English trigrams with a hyphen as the second word are typically extractable, meaning that the first and third words align to consecutive Chinese words.</S>
          <S ID="S-30861">When any conjugation of the word &#8220;to be&#8221; is followed by a verb, indicating passive voice or progressive tense, the two words tend to align together.</S>
          <S ID="S-30862">Our feature set also includes bias features on phrasal rules and links, which control the number of null-aligned words and number of rules licensed.</S>

      <P>
        <S ID="S-31040">Our extraction set model serves to coordinate the alignment and translation model components of a statistical translation system by unifying their representations.</S>
        <S ID="S-31041">Moreover, our model provides an effective alternative to phrase alignment models that choose a particular phrase segmentation; instead, we predict many overlapping phrases, both large and small, that are mutually consistent.</S>
        <S ID="S-31042">In future work, we look forward to developing extraction set models for richer formalisms, including hierarchical grammars.</S>
