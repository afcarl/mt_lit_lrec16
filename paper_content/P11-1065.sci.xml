      <P>
        <S ID="S-32103">Recent advances in Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) are widely centred around two concepts: (a) hierarchical translation processes, frequently employing Synchronous Context Free Grammars (SCFGs) and (b) transduction or synchronous rewrite processes over a linguistic syntactic tree.</S>
        <S ID="S-32104">SCFGs in the form of the Inversion-Transduction Grammar (ITG) were first introduced by (Wu, 1997) as a formalism to recursively describe the translation process.</S>
        <S ID="S-32105">The Hiero system (Chiang, 2005) 642</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-32106">utilised an ITG-flavour which focused on hierarchical phrase-pairs to capture context-driven translation and reordering patterns with &#8216;gaps&#8217;, offering competitive performance particularly for language pairs with extensive reordering.</S>
        <S ID="S-32107">As Hiero uses a single non-terminal and concentrates on overcoming translation lexicon sparsity, it barely explores the recursive nature of translation past the lexical level.</S>
        <S ID="S-32108">Nevertheless, the successful employment of SCFGs for phrase-based SMT brought translation models assuming latent syntactic structure to the spotlight.</S>
        <S ID="S-32109">Simultaneously, mounting efforts have been directed towards SMT models employing linguistic syntax on the source side (Yamada and Knight, 2001; Quirk et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2006), target side (Galley et al., 2004; Galley et al., 2006) or both (Zhang et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2009; Chiang, 2010).</S>
        <S ID="S-32110">Hierarchical translation was combined with target side linguistic annotation in (Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006).</S>
        <S ID="S-32111">Interestingly, early on (Koehn et al., 2003) exemplified the difficulties of integrating linguistic information in translation systems.</S>
        <S ID="S-32112">Syntaxbased MT often suffers from inadequate constraints in the translation rules extracted, or from striving to combine these rules together towards a full derivation.</S>
        <S ID="S-32113">Recent research tries to address these issues, by re-structuring training data parse trees to better suit syntax-based SMT training (Wang et al., 2010), or by moving from linguistically motivated synchronous grammars to systems where linguistic plausibility of the translation is assessed through additional features in a phrase-based system (Venugopal et al., 2009; Chiang et al., 2009), obscuring the impact of higher level syntactic processes.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-32114">While it is assumed that linguistic structure does correlate with some translation phenomena, in this</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-32115">work we do not employ it as the backbone of translation.</S>
        <S ID="S-32116">In place of linguistically constrained translation imposing syntactic parse structure, we opt for linguistically motivated translation.</S>
        <S ID="S-32117">We learn latent hierarchical structure, taking advantage of linguistic annotations but shaped and trained for translation.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-32118">We start by labelling each phrase-pair span in the word-aligned training data with multiple linguistically motivated categories, offering multi-grained abstractions from its lexical content.</S>
        <S ID="S-32119">These phrasepair label charts are the input of our learning algorithm, which extracts the linguistically motivated rules and estimates the probabilities for a stochastic SCFG, without arbitrary constraints such as phrase or span sizes.</S>
        <S ID="S-32120">Estimating such grammars under a Maximum Likelihood criterion is known to be plagued by strong overfitting leading to degenerate estimates (DeNero et al., 2006).</S>
        <S ID="S-32121">In contrast, our learning objective not only avoids overfitting the training data but, most importantly, learns joint stochastic synchronous grammars which directly aim at generalisation towards yet unseen instances.</S>
        <S ID="S-32122">By advancing from structures which mimic linguistic syntax, to learning linguistically aware latent recursive structures targeting translation, we achieve significant improvements in translation quality for 4 different language pairs in comparison with a strong hierarchical translation baseline.</S>
        <S ID="S-32123">Our key contributions are presented in the following sections.</S>
        <S ID="S-32124">Section 2 discusses the weak independence assumptions of SCFGs and introduces a joint translation model which addresses these issues and separates hierarchical translation structure from phrase-pair emission.</S>
        <S ID="S-32125">In section 3 we consider a chart over phrase-pair spans filled with sourcelanguage linguistically motivated labels.</S>
        <S ID="S-32126">We show how we can employ this crucial input to extract and train a hierarchical translation structure model with millions of rules.</S>
        <S ID="S-32127">Section 4 demonstrates decoding with the model by constraining derivations to linguistic hints of the source sentence and presents our empirical results.</S>
        <S ID="S-32128">We close with a discussion of related work and our conclusions.</S>

          <S ID="S-32142">The result is that, the reordering pattern with the highest probability will always be preferred (e.g. in the Viterbi derivation) over the rest, irrespective of lexical or abstract context.</S>
          <S ID="S-32143">As an example, a probabilistic SCFG will always assign a higher probability to derivations swapping or monotonically translating nouns and adjectives between English and French, only depending on which of the two rules NP &#8594; [NN JJ], NP &#8594; &#12296;NN JJ&#12297; has a higher probability.</S>
          <S ID="S-32144">The rest of the (sometimes thousands of) rule-specific features usually added to SCFG translation models do not directly help either, leaving reordering decisions disconnected from the rest of the derivation.</S>

        <P>
          <S ID="S-32145">While in a decoder this is somehow mitigated by the use of a language model, we believe that the weakness of straightforward applications of SCFGs to model reordering structure at the sentence level misses a chance to learn this crucial part of the translation process during grammar induction.</S>
          <S ID="S-32146">As (Mylonakis and Sima&#8217;an, 2010) note, &#8216;plain&#8217; SCFGs seem to perform worse than the grammars described next, mainly due to wrong long-range reordering decisions for which the language model can hardly help.</S>

        <P>
          <S ID="S-32147">We address the weaknesses mentioned above by relying on an SCFG grammar design that is similar to the &#8216;Lexicalised Reordering&#8217; grammar of (Mylonakis and Sima&#8217;an, 2010).</S>
          <S ID="S-32148">As in the rules of Figure 1, we separate non-terminals according to the reordering patterns in which they participate.</S>
          <S ID="S-32149">Nonterminals such as B L , C R take part only in swapping right-hand sides &#12296;B L C R &#12297; (with B L swapping from the source side&#8217;s left to the target side&#8217;s right, C R swapping in the opposite direction), while non-terminals such as B, C take part solely in monotone right-hand side expansions [B C].</S>
          <S ID="S-32150">These nonterminal categories can appear also on the left-hand side of a rule, as in rule (c) of Figure 1.</S>

          <S ID="S-32270">Source Labels Constraints As for this work the phrase-pair labels used to extract the grammar are based on the linguistic analysis of the source side, we can construct the label chart for every input sentence from its parse.</S>

          <S ID="S-32277">As our grammar uses non-terminals in the hundreds of thousands, it is important not to prune away prematurely non-terminals covering smaller spans and to leave more options to be considered as we move up the derivation tree.</S>

          <S ID="S-32279">This allows full derivations to be found for all input sentences, as well as avoids aggressive pruning at an early stage.</S>
          <S ID="S-32280">Given the source label constraint discussed above, this does not increase running times or memory demands considerably as we allow only up to a few tens of nonterminals per span.</S>

          <S ID="S-32281">Expected Counts Rule Pruning To compact the hierarchical structure part of the grammar prior to decoding, we prune rules that fail to accumulate 10 &#8722;8 expected counts during the last CV-EM iteration.</S>
          <S ID="S-32282">For English to German, this brings the structural rules from 15M down to 1.2M.</S>

          <S ID="S-32325">The latter system then uses a labels chart as that of Figure 3, which however labels all phrase-pair spans solely with the generic X label.</S>
          <S ID="S-32326">The results in Table 2(a) indicate that a large part of the performance improvement can be attributed to the use of the linguistic annotations extracted from the source parse trees, indicating the potential of the LTS system to take advantage of such additional annotations to deliver better translations.</S>
          <S ID="S-32327">The second additional experiment relates to the impact of employing a stronger language model during decoding, which may increase performance but slows down decoding speed.</S>
          <S ID="S-32328">Notably, as can be seen in Table 2(b), switching to a 4-gram LM results in performance gains for both the baseline and our system and while the margin between the two systems decreases, our system continues to deliver a considerable and significant improvement in translation BLEU scores.</S>

        <S ID="S-32347">Most of the aforementioned work does concentrate on learning hierarchical, linguistically motivated translation models.</S>

      <HEADER>6 Conclusions</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-32354">In this work we contribute a method to learn and apply latent hierarchical translation structure.</S>
        <S ID="S-32355">To this end, we take advantage of source-language linguistic annotations to motivate instead of constrain the translation process.</S>
        <S ID="S-32356">An input chart over phrasepair spans, with each cell filled with multiple linguistically motivated labels, is coupled with the HR- SCFG design to arrive at a rich synchronous grammar with millions of structural rules and the capacity to capture complex linguistically conditioned translation phenomena.</S>
        <S ID="S-32357">We address overfitting issues by cross-validating climbing the likelihood of the training data and propose solutions to increase the efficiency and accuracy of decoding.</S>
        <S ID="S-32358">An interesting aspect of our work is delivering competitive performance for difficult language pairs such as English-Chinese with a joint probability generative model and an SCFG without &#8216;gap rules&#8217;.</S>
        <S ID="S-32359">650</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-32360">Instead of employing hierarchical phrase-pairs, we invest in learning the higher-order hierarchical synchronous structure behind translation, up to the full sentence length.</S>
        <S ID="S-32361">While these choices and the related results challenge current MT research trends, they are not mutually exclusive with them.</S>
        <S ID="S-32362">Future work directions include investigating the impact of hierarchical phrases for our models as well as any gains from additional features in the log-linear decoding model.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-32363">Smoothing the HR-SCFG grammar estimates could prove a possible source of further performance improvements.</S>
        <S ID="S-32364">Learning translation and reordering behaviour with respect to linguistic cues is facilitated in our approach by keeping separate phrase-pair emission distributions per emitting nonterminal and reordering pattern, while the employment of the generic X non-terminals already allows backing off to more coarse-grained rules.</S>
        <S ID="S-32365">Nevertheless, we still believe that further smoothing of these sparse distributions, e.g. by interpolating them with less sparse ones, could in the future lead to an additional increase in translation quality.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-32366">Finally, we discuss in this work how our method can already utilise hundreds of thousands of phrasepair labels and millions of structural rules.</S>
        <S ID="S-32367">A further promising direction is broadening this set with labels taking advantage of both source and targetlanguage linguistic annotation or categories exploring additional phrase-pair properties past the parse trees such as semantic annotations.</S>
