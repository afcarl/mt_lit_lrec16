      <P>
        <S ID="S-50023">Aside from improving the performance of coretranslation models, there additionally exist two orthogonal approaches via which fully-automatic translations can achieve increased acceptance and better integration in real-world use cases.</S>
        <S ID="S-50024">These two approaches are: improved translation accuracy via system combination (<REF ID="R-17" RPTR="19">Rosti et al., 2008</REF>; <REF ID="R-11" RPTR="13">Karakos et al., 2008</REF>; <REF ID="R-09" RPTR="10">Hildebrand and Vogel, 2008</REF>), and automatic quality-estimation techniques used as an additional layer on top of MT systems, which present the user only with translations that are predicted as being accurate (<REF ID="R-18" RPTR="21">Soricut and Echihabi, 2010</REF>; <REF ID="R-20" RPTR="30">Specia, 2011</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-50025">In this paper, we describe new contributions to both these approaches.</S>
        <S ID="S-50026">First, we present a novel and superior technique for performing quality estimation at document level.</S>

        <S ID="S-50032">A document-level score is then recreated based on the predicted sentence-level sufficient statistics.</S>
        <S ID="S-50033">A second contribution is related to system combination (or, to be more precise, system selection).</S>
        <S ID="S-50034">This is an intended side-effect of the granularity change: since the sentence-level statistics allow us to make quality predictions at sentence level, we can use these predictions to perform system combination by selecting among various sentence-level translations produced by different MT systems.</S>
        <S ID="S-50035">That is, instead of presenting the user with a document with sentences translated entirely by a single system, we can present documents for which, say, 60% of the sentences were translated by system A, and 40% were translated by system B.</S>
        <S ID="S-50036">We contribute a novel set of features and several techniques for choosing between competing machine translation outputs.</S>

      <P>
        <S ID="S-50038">Several approaches to reference-free automatic MT quality assessment have been proposed, using classification (<REF ID="R-13" RPTR="16">Kulesza and Shieber, 2004</REF>), regression (<REF ID="R-00" RPTR="0">Albrecht and Hwa, 2007</REF>), and ranking (Ye et al., 2007; <REF ID="R-06" RPTR="6">Duh, 2008</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-50039">The focus of these approaches is on system performance evaluation, as they use a constant test set and measure various MT systems against it.</S>
        <S ID="S-50040">In contrast, we are interested in evaluating the quality of the translations themselves, while treat-</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-50041">ing the MT components as constants.</S>
        <S ID="S-50042">In this respect, the goal is more related to the area of confidence estimation for MT (<REF ID="R-02" RPTR="2">Blatz et al., 2004</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-50043">Confidence estimation is usually concerned with identifying words/phrases for which one can be confident in the quality of the translation.</S>
        <S ID="S-50044">A sentencelevel approach to quality estimation is taken on the classification-based work of <REF ID="R-07" RPTR="7">Gamon et al. (2005)</REF> and regression-based work of <REF ID="R-19" RPTR="28">Specia et al. (2009)</REF>.</S>
        <S ID="S-50045">Our approach to quality estimation focuses on both sentence-level and document-level estimation.</S>
        <S ID="S-50046">We improve on the quality estimation technique that is proposed for document-level estimation in (<REF ID="R-18" RPTR="23">Soricut and Echihabi, 2010</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-50047">Furthermore, we exploit the availability of multiple translation hypotheses to perform system combination.</S>
        <S ID="S-50048">Our system combination methods are based on generic Machine Learning techniques, applied on 1-best output strings.</S>
        <S ID="S-50049">In contrast, most of the approaches to MT system combination combine N-best lists from multiple MT systems via confusion network decoding (<REF ID="R-11" RPTR="14">Karakos et al., 2008</REF>; <REF ID="R-17" RPTR="20">Rosti et al., 2008</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-50050">The closest system combination approach to our work is (<REF ID="R-09" RPTR="11">Hildebrand and Vogel, 2008</REF>), where an ensemble of hypotheses is generated by combining N-best lists from all the participating systems, and a log-linear model is trained to select the best translation from all the possible candidates.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-50051">In our work, we show that it is possible to gain significant translation quality by taking advantage of only two participating systems.</S>
        <S ID="S-50052">This makes the system-combination proposition much more palatable in real production deployment scenarios for Machine Translation, as opposed to pure research scenarios as the ones used in the previous NIST and DARPA/GALE MT efforts (Olive et al., 2011).</S>
        <S ID="S-50053">As our evaluations show, the two participating systems can be at very similar performance levels, and yet a system-selection procedure using Machine Learning techniques can achieve significant translation improvements in quality.</S>
        <S ID="S-50054">In addition, in a scenario where quality estimation needs to happen as a requirement for MT integration in large applications, having two translation systems producing translations for the same inputs is part of the deployment set-up (<REF ID="R-18" RPTR="24">Soricut and Echihabi, 2010</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-50055">The improvement in overall translation quality comes in these cases at near-zero cost.</S>

      <HEADER>3 Sentence-level Quality Predictions</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-50164">The requirement for document-level quality estimation comes from the need to present a fullyautomated translation solution, in which translated documents are either good enough to be directly published (or otherwise must undergo, say, a humandriven post-processing pipeline).</S>
        <S ID="S-50165">In the proposal of Soricut and Echihabi (2010), regression models predict BLEU-like scores for each document, based on document-level features.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-50166">However, even if the predicted value is at document-level, the actual feature computation and model prediction does not necessarily need to happen at document-level.</S>
        <S ID="S-50167">It is one of the goals of this work to determine if the models of prediction work better at a coarser granularity (such as document level) or finer granularity (such as sentence-level).</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-50168">We describe here a mechanism for predicting BLEU scores at sentence level, and then combining these scores into document-level scores.</S>
        <S ID="S-50169">To make explicit our prediction mechanism, we present here in detail the formula for computing BLEU scores (<REF ID="R-16" RPTR="18">Papineni et al., 2002</REF>).</S>

        <P>
          <S ID="S-50141">We measure the impact in ranking accuracy using a variety of European and Asian language pairs, using parallel data from various domains.</S>
          <S ID="S-50142">One domain we use is the publicly available WMT09 data (<REF ID="R-12" RPTR="15">Koehn and Haddow, 2009</REF>), a combination of European parliament and news data.</S>
          <S ID="S-50143">Another domain, called Travel, consists of user-generated reviews and descriptions; and a third domain, called HiTech, consists of parallel data from customer support for the high-tech industry.</S>
          <S ID="S-50144">Using these parallel data sets, we train statistical phrase-based MT system similar to (<REF ID="R-14" RPTR="17">Och and Ney, 2004</REF>) as primary systems (Sys1).</S>
          <S ID="S-50145">As secondary systems (Sys2) we use phrase-based systems equipped with linguistically-oriented modules similar with the ones proposed in (<REF ID="R-05" RPTR="5">Collins et al., 2005</REF>; <REF ID="R-21" RPTR="33">Xu et al., 2009</REF>).</S>
          <S ID="S-50146">Table 1 lists the size of the parallel training data on which the MT systems were trained in the first column, and BLEU scores for the primary and secondary systems on held-out 1000-sentence test sets in the next two columns.</S>

        <P>
          <S ID="S-50147">The training material for the regression-tree models consists of 1000-document held-out sets.</S>

          <S ID="S-50149">) Similarly, the Ranking test sets we use consist of 1000- document held-out sets (see column 4 in Table 1 for size).</S>
          <S ID="S-50150">In the last four columns of Table 1, we show the results for ranking the translations produced by the primary MT system (Sys1).</S>

        <P>
          <S ID="S-50155">Both rAcc[2] and DeltaAvg[2] numbers support the choice of making document-level BLEU prediction at a finer, sentence-based granularity level.</S>
          <S ID="S-50156">For Travel English-French, for instance, the accuracy of the ranking improves from 77% to 80%.</S>
          <S ID="S-50157">To put some intuition behind these numbers, it means that 4 out of every 5 sentences that the ranker places in the top 50% do belong there.</S>
          <S ID="S-50158">At the same time, the DeltaAvg[2] numbers for Travel English-French indicate that the translation quality of the top 50% of the 1000 Ranking Test documents exceeds by 10.1 BLEU points the overall quality of the translations (up from 9.1 BLEU points for the documentlevel prediction).</S>
          <S ID="S-50159">This large gap in the BLEU score of the top 50% ranked sentences and the overallcorpus BLEU indicates that these top-ranked translations are indeed of much better quality (closer to the human-produced references).</S>
          <S ID="S-50160">The same large numbers are measured on the WMT09 data for Hungarian-English.</S>
          <S ID="S-50161">This is a set for which it is hard to obtain significant improvements via core-model translation improvements.</S>

          <S ID="S-50163">This set of top 50% sentences also has an overall BLEU score of 35.3, which is better by +8.4 BLEU-points compared to the overall BLEU score of 26.9 (we only show the base overall BLEU score and the BLEUpoint gain in Table 2 to avoid displaying redundant information).</S>

          <S ID="S-50190">We use SVM-rank with a linear kernel and the same feature set as the regression-based method (we make the observation here that only the target-based features have discriminative power in this context).</S>

        <P>
          <S ID="S-50198">tion techniques are significant.</S>
          <S ID="S-50199">For instance, both the Regression-based system combination and the Ranking-based system combination achieve a BLEU score of 29.0 on the WMT09 Hungarian- English test set, an increase of +2.1 BLEU points.</S>
          <S ID="S-50200">In the case of Travel English-French, an increase of +1.6 BLEU points is obtained by the Regressionbased system combination, in spite of the fact that one of the systems is measured to be 2.3 BLEU points lower in translation accuracy.</S>
          <S ID="S-50201">Increases in the range of +1.5-2.0 BLEU points are obtained across all the experimental conditions that we tried: three different domains, various language pairs (both in and out of English), and various training data sizes (from 0.4Mw to 40Mw).</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-50202">Since our system-combination methods chose one system translation over another system translation, we can also measure the distribution of choices made between the two participating systems.</S>
          <S ID="S-50203">These bimodal distributions can help us gauge the performance of various methods, when compared against the BLEU Oracle distribution.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-50204">In Table 3, we report the percentages of sentences selected from each system in the oracle combination and each of the described system combination methods.</S>
          <S ID="S-50205">We also report the Kullback-Liebler divergence (KL) between the BLEU Oracle distribution and the distribution induced by each of the system combination methods.</S>
          <S ID="S-50206">The results indicate that, for both English-French cases that we considered (in the Travel and HiTech domains), the choice distribution of the Regression-based system combination method is much closer to the oracle distribution (KL of 0.68 and 0.11, respectively), compared to the other two methods.</S>
          <S ID="S-50207">Note that this does not necessarily correlate with the evaluation based on overall BLEU score of the system-combination methods (Table 2).</S>
          <S ID="S-50208">For instance, for HiTech English- French the best BLEU improvement is obtained by the Rank-based method with +1.7 BLEU points, but the KL divergence score of 3.31 is higher than the one for the Regression-based method (KL score of 0.11).</S>
          <S ID="S-50209">Nevertheless, the choice distributions are an important factor in judging the performance of a given system selection method.</S>

      <HEADER>5 Conclusions</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-50212">Document-level quality estimation is an important component for building fully-automated translation solutions where the translated documents are directly published, without the need for human intervention.</S>
        <S ID="S-50213">Such approaches are the only possible solu- 169 tion to mitigate the imperfection of current MT technology and the need to translate large volumes of data on a continuous basis.</S>
        <S ID="S-50214">We show in this paper that sentence-level predictions, when aggregated to document-level predictions, outperform previously-proposed documentlevel quality estimation algorithms.</S>
        <S ID="S-50215">In addition to that, these finer-granularity, sentence-level predictions can be used as part of a system selection scheme.</S>
        <S ID="S-50216">The three alternative system selection techniques we describe here are intuitive, computationally cheap, and bring significant BLEU gains across multiple domains and language pairs.</S>
        <S ID="S-50217">The finding that the regression-based system selection technique performs as well (or sometimes better) compared to the discriminative methods fits well with the overall theme of using two systems for both improved quality estimation and improved MT performance.</S>
