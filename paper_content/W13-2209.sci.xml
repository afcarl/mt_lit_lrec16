          <S ID="S-53272">We used an open source SMT system Moses (Koehn et al., 2007) for all our experiments excluding the one described in Section 4.1 due to its performance constraints.</S>
          <S ID="S-53273">To overcome the limitation we employed our in-house decoder.</S>
          <S ID="S-53274">Language models (LM) were created with an open source IRSTLM toolkit (<REF ID="R-04" RPTR="4">Federico et al., 2008</REF>).</S>

          <S ID="S-53276">We used an open source MGIZA++ tool (<REF ID="R-06" RPTR="6">Gao and Vogel, 2008</REF>) to compute word alignment.</S>
          <S ID="S-53277">To obtain part of speech (POS) tags we used an open source Stanford POS tagger for English (<REF ID="R-12" RPTR="13">Toutanova et al., 2003</REF>) and an open source suite of language analyzers, FreeLing 3.0 (<REF ID="R-01" RPTR="1">Carreras et al., 2004</REF>; <REF ID="R-09" RPTR="9">Padr&#243; and Stanilovsky, 2012</REF>), for Russian.</S>
          <S ID="S-53278">We utilized a closed source free for noncommercial use morphological analyzer, Mystem (<REF ID="R-11" RPTR="11">Segalovich, 2003</REF>), that used a limited dictionary to obtain lemmas.</S>
          <S ID="S-53279">We also made use of the in-house language recognizer based on (<REF ID="R-03" RPTR="3">Dunning, 1994</REF>) and a spelling corrector designed on the basis of the work of <REF ID="R-02" RPTR="2">Cucerzan and Brill (2004)</REF>.</S>
          <S ID="S-53280">We report all results in case-sensitive BLEU (<REF ID="R-10" RPTR="10">Papineni et al., 2002</REF>) using mt-eval13a script from Moses distribution.</S>

        <P>
          <S ID="S-53301">In this particular case we can drop the inflections, but for other categories they can still be useful for translation, because the information they contain appears in function words in English.</S>
          <S ID="S-53302">On the other hand, most of Russian morphology is useless for word alignment.</S>
          <S ID="S-53303">We applied a morphological analyzer Mystem (<REF ID="R-11" RPTR="12">Segalovich, 2003</REF>) to the Russian text and converted each word to its dictionary form.</S>

          <S ID="S-53348">This means that a Latin word being transfered into Cyrillic and then transliterated back to Latin produces an artificial word form.</S>

          <S ID="S-53350">Twelve systems either dropped one of the words or left it in Cyrillic.</S>
          <S ID="S-53351">We provide a list of typical mistakes in order of their frequency: Khavard Khalvarsen, Khavard Khal&#8217;varsen, Xavard Xaljvarsen.</S>

          <S ID="S-53353">The next issue is the presence of non-null inflections that most certainly would result in wrong translation by any straight-forward algorithm.</S>

          <S ID="S-53370">Idiomatic expressions are hard to discover and dangerous to translate literary.</S>
          <S ID="S-53371">E.g. a Russian idiom &#1073;&#1099;&#1083;&#1072; &#1085;&#1077; &#1073;&#1099;&#1083;&#1072; (let come what may) being translated word by word would result in was not was.</S>
          <S ID="S-53372">Neither of the commercial systems we checked managed to collect sufficient statistic to translate this very popular expression.</S>

      <HEADER>6 Conclusion</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-53374">We have described the primary systems developed by the team of Yandex School of Data Analysis for WMT13 shared translation task.</S>
        <S ID="S-53375">We have reported on the experiments and demonstrated considerable improvements over the respective baseline.</S>
        <S ID="S-53376">Among the most notable techniques are data filtering, spelling correction, alignment of lemmatized word forms and transliteration.</S>
        <S ID="S-53377">We have analyzed the drawbacks of our systems and shared the ideas for further research.</S>
