      <P>
        <S ID="S-31421">Statistical Machine Translation(SMT) is currently the state of the art solution to the machine translation.</S>
        <S ID="S-31422">Phrase based SMT is also among the top performing approaches available as of today.</S>
        <S ID="S-31423">This approach is a purely lexical approach, using surface forms of the words in the parallel corpus to generate the translations and estimate probabilities.</S>
        <S ID="S-31424">It is possible to incorporate syntactical information into this framework through different ways.</S>
        <S ID="S-31425">Source side syntax based re-ordering as preprocessing step, dependency based reordering models, cohesive decoding features are among many available successful attempts for the integration of syntax into the translation model.</S>
        <S ID="S-31426">Factored translation modeling is another way to achieve this goal.</S>
        <S ID="S-31427">These models allow each word to be represented as a vector of factors rather than a single surface form.</S>
        <S ID="S-31428">Factors can represent richer expression power on each word.</S>
        <S ID="S-31429">Any factors such as word stems, gender, part of speech, tense, etc. can be easily used in this framework.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-31430">Previous work in factored translation modeling have reported consistent improvements from Part of Speech(POS) tags, morphology, gender, and case factors (Koehn et.</S>
        <S ID="S-31431">a.</S>
        <S ID="S-31432">2007).</S>
        <S ID="S-31433">In another work, Birch et.</S>
        <S ID="S-31434">al. 2007 have achieved improvement using Combinational Categorial Grammar (CCG) super-tag factors.</S>
        <S ID="S-31435">Creating the factors is done as a preprocessing step, and so far, most of the experiments have assumed existence of external tools for the creation of these factors (i. e. Part of speech taggers, CCG parsers, etc.).</S>
        <S ID="S-31436">Unfortunately high quality language processing tools, especially for the open domain, are not available for most languages.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-31437">While linguistically identifiable representations (i.e. POS tags, CCG supertags, etc) have been very frequently used as factors in many applications including MT, simpler representations have also been effective in achieving the same result in other application areas.</S>
        <S ID="S-31438"><REF ID="R-02" RPTR="0">Grzymala-Busse and Old 1997</REF>, DINCER et.al.</S>
        <S ID="S-31439">2008, were able to use fixed length suffixes as features for training a POS tagging.</S>
        <S ID="S-31440">In another work Saberi and Perrot 1999 showed that reversing middle chunks of the words while keeping the first and last part intact, does not decrease listeners&#8217; recognition ability.</S>
        <S ID="S-31441">This result is very relevant to Machine Translation, suggesting that inaccurate context which is usually modeled with n-gram language models, can still be as effective as accurate surface forms.</S>
        <S ID="S-31442">Another research (Rawlinson 1997) confirms this finding; this time in textual domain, observing that randomization of letters in the middle of words has little or no effect on the ability of skilled readers to understand the text.</S>
        <S ID="S-31443">These results suggest that the inexpensive representational factors which do not need unavailable tools might also be worth investigating.</S>
        <S ID="S-31444">These results encouraged us to introduce language independent simple factors for machine translation.</S>
        <S ID="S-31445">In this paper, following the work of Grzymala-Busse et.</S>
        <S ID="S-31446">al. we used fixed length suf-</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-31447">fix as word factor, to lower the perplexity of the language model, and have the factors roughly function as part of speech tags, thus increasing the grammaticality of the translation results.</S>
        <S ID="S-31448">We were able to obtain consistent, significant improvements over our baseline in 3 different experiments, large NIST Arabic to English system, medium WMT Spanish to English system, and small TRANSTAC English to Iraqi system.</S>

        <S ID="S-31449">The rest of this paper is as follows.</S>
        <S ID="S-31450">Section 2 briefly reviews the Factored Translation Models.</S>
        <S ID="S-31451">In section 3 we will introduce our model, and section 4 will contain the experiments and the analysis of the results, and finally, we will conclude this paper in section 5.</S>

      <HEADER>2 Factored Translation Model</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-31452">Statistical Machine Translation uses the log linear combination of a number of features, to compute the highest probable hypothesis as the translation.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-31453">e = argmax e p(e|f) = argmax e p exp &#931; i=1 n &#955; i h i (e,f)</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-31454">In phrase based SMT, assuming the source and target phrase segmentation as {(f i ,e i )}, the most important features include: the Language Model feature h lm (e,f) = p lm (e); the phrase translation feature h t (e,f) defined as product of translation probabilities, lexical probabilities and phrase penalty; and the reordering probability, h d (e,f), usually defined as &#960; i=1</S>

      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-31457">Factored Translation Model, recently introduced by (Koehn et.</S>
        <S ID="S-31458">al. 2007), allow words to have a vector representation.</S>
        <S ID="S-31459">The model can then extend the definition of each of the features from a uni-dimensional value to an arbitrary joint and conditional combination of features.</S>
        <S ID="S-31460">Phrase based SMT is in fact a special case of Factored SMT.</S>
        <S ID="S-31461">The factored features are defined as an extension of phrase translation features.</S>
        <S ID="S-31462">The function &#964;(f j ,e j ), which was defined for a phrase pair before, can now be extended as a log linear combination &#931; f &#964; f (f jf ,e jf ).</S>
        <S ID="S-31463">The model also allows for a generation feature, defining the relationship between final surface form and target factors.</S>
        <S ID="S-31464">Other features include additional language model features over individual factors, and factored reordering features.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-31465">Figure 1 shows an example of a possible factored model.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-31466">In this particular model, words on both source and target side are represented as a vector of four factors: surface form, lemma, part of speech (POS) and the morphology.</S>
        <S ID="S-31467">The target phrase is generated as follows: Source word lemma generates target word lemma.</S>
        <S ID="S-31468">Source word's Part of speech and morphology together generate the target word's part of speech and morphology, and from its lemma, part of speech and morphology the surface form of the target word is finally generated.</S>
        <S ID="S-31469">This model has been able to result in higher translation BLEU score as well as grammatical coherency for English to German, English to Spanish, English to Czech, English to Chinese, Chinese to English and German to English.</S>

      <P>
        <S ID="S-31470">Part of speech tagging, constituent and dependency parsing, combinatory categorical grammar super tagging are used extensively in most applications when syntactic representations are needed.</S>
        <S ID="S-31471">However training these tools require medium size treebanks and tagged data, which for most languages will not be available for a while.</S>
        <S ID="S-31472">On the other hand, many simple words features, such as their character n-grams, have in fact proven to be comparably as effective in many applications.</S>

        <S ID="S-31475">They compared surface form, stemmed words, character n-grams, and semantic relationships, and found that for noisy and open domain text, character-ngrams outperform other representations when used for text classification.</S>
        <S ID="S-31476">In another work (Dincer et al 2009) showed that using fixed length word ending outperforms whole word representation for training a part of speech tagger for Turkish language.</S>
