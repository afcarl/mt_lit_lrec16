    <A-S ID="S-42022">Based on a study of verb translations in the Europarl corpus, we argue that a wide range of MWE patterns can be identified in translations that exhibit a correspondence between a single lexical item in the source language and a group of lexical items in the target language.</A-S>

      <P>
        <S ID="S-42025">Parallel corpora have proved to be a valuable resource not only for statistical machine translation, but also for crosslingual induction of morphological, syntactic and semantic analyses (Yarowsky et al., 2001; <REF ID="R-04" RPTR="4">Dyvik, 2004</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-42026">In this paper, we propose an approach to the identification of multiword expressions (MWEs) that exploits translational correspondences in a parallel corpus.</S>
        <S ID="S-42027">We will consider in translations of the following type:</S>

        <S ID="S-42031">This sentence pair has been taken from the German - English section of the Europarl corpus (<REF ID="R-08" RPTR="8">Koehn, 2005</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-42032">It exemplifies a translational correspondence between an English MWE take account of and a German simplex verb ber&#252;cksichtigen.</S>
        <S ID="S-42033">In the following, we refer to such correspondences as one-to-many translations.</S>
        <S ID="S-42034">Based on a study of verb translations in Europarl, we will explore to what extent one-to-many translations provide evidence for MWE realization in the target language.</S>
        <S ID="S-42035">It will turn out that crosslingual correspondences realize a wide range of different linguistic patterns that are relevant for MWE identification, but that they pose problems to automatic word alignment.</S>
        <S ID="S-42036">We propose an extraction method that combines distributional word alignment with syntactic filters.</S>
        <S ID="S-42037">We will show that these correspondences can be reliably detected on dependency-parsed, wordaligned sentences and are able to identify various MWE patterns.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-42038">In a monolingual setting, the task of MWE extraction is usually conceived of as a lexical association problem where distributional measures model the syntactic and semantic idiosyncracy exhibited by MWEs, e.g. (<REF ID="R-11" RPTR="12">Pecina, 2008</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-42039">This approach generally involves two main steps: 1) the extraction of a candidate list of potential MWEs, often constrained by a particular target pattern of the detection method, like verb particle constructions (<REF ID="R-01" RPTR="1">Baldwin and Villavicencio, 2002</REF>) or verb PP combinations (Villada <REF ID="R-14" RPTR="18">Moir&#243;n and Tiedemann, 2006</REF>), 2) the ranking of this candidate list by an appropriate assocation measure.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-42040">The crosslingual MWE identification we present in this paper is, a priori, independent of any specific association measure or syntactic pattern.</S>
        <S ID="S-42041">The translation scenario allows us to adopt a completely data-driven definition of what constitutes an MWE: Given a parallel corpus, we propose to consider those tokens in a target language as MWEs which correspond to a single lexical item in the source language.</S>
        <S ID="S-42042">The intuition is that if a group of lexical items in one language can be realized as a single item in another language, it can be considered as some kind of lexically fixed entity.</S>
        <S ID="S-42043">By this means, we will not approach the MWE identification problem by asking for a given list of candidates whether these are MWEs or not.</S>
        <S ID="S-42044">Instead, we will ask for a given list of lexical items in a source language whether there exists a one-to-many translation for this item in a target language (and whether these</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-42045">one-to-many translations correspond to MWEs).</S>
        <S ID="S-42046">This strategy offers a straightforward solution to the interpretation problem: As the translation can be related to the meaning of the source item and to its other translations in the target language, the interpretation is independent of the expression&#8217;s transparency.</S>
        <S ID="S-42047">This solution has its limitations compared to other approaches that need to automatically establish the degree of compositionality of a given MWE candidate.</S>
        <S ID="S-42048">However, for many NLP applications, coarse-grained knowledge about the semantic relation between a wide range of MWEs and their corresponding atomic realization is already very useful.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-42049">In this work, we therefore focus on a general method of MWE identification that captures the various patterns of translational correspondences that can be found in parallel corpora.</S>
        <S ID="S-42050">Our experiments described in section 3 show that one-tomany translations should be extracted from syntactic configurations rather than from unstructured sets of aligned words.</S>
        <S ID="S-42051">This syntax-driven method is less dependent on frequency distributions in a given corpus, but is based on the intuition that monolingual idiosyncracies like MWE realization of an entity are not likely to be mirrored in another language (see section 4 for discussion).</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-42052">Our goal in this paper is twofold: First, we want to investigate to what extent one-to-many translational correspondences can serve as an empirical basis for MWE identification.</S>
        <S ID="S-42053">To this end, Section 2 presents a corpus-based study of the relation between one-to-many translations and MWEs that we carried out on a translation gold standard.</S>
        <S ID="S-42054">Second, we investigate methods for the automatic detection of complex lexical correspondences for a given parallel corpus.</S>
        <S ID="S-42055">Therefore, Section 3 evaluates automatic word alignments against our gold standard and gives a method for high-precision one-to-many translation detection that relies on syntactic filters, in addition to word-alignments.</S>

        <S ID="S-42065">We constructed a gold standard covering all English translations of four German verb lemmas extracted from the Europarl Corpus.</S>
        <S ID="S-42066">These verbs subcategorize for a nominative subject and an accusative object and are in the middle frequency layer (around 200 occurrences).</S>
        <S ID="S-42067">We extracted all sentences in Europarl with occurences of these lemmas and their automatic word alignments produced by GIZA++ (<REF ID="R-10" RPTR="10">Och and Ney, 2003</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-42068">These alignments were manually corrected on the basis of the crosslingual word alignment guidelines developped by (Gra&#231;a et al., 2008).</S>
        <S ID="S-42069">For each of the German source lemmas, our gold standard records four translation categories: one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, many-tomany translations.</S>
        <S ID="S-42070">Table 1 shows the distribution of these categories for each verb.</S>
        <S ID="S-42071">Strikingly, the four verbs show very different proportions concerning the types of their translational correspondences.</S>
        <S ID="S-42072">Thus, while the German verb anheben (en.</S>
        <S ID="S-42073">increase) seems to have a frequent parallel realization, the verbs bezwecken (en.</S>
        <S ID="S-42074">intend to) or verschlimmern (en.</S>
        <S ID="S-42075">aggravate) tend to be realized by more complex phrasal translations.</S>
        <S ID="S-42076">In any case, the percentage of one-to-many translations is relatively high which corroborates our hypothesis that parallel corpora constitute a very interesting resource for data-driven MWE discovery.</S>

      <P>
        <S ID="S-42077">A closer look at the one-to-many translations reveals that these cover a wide spectrum of MWE phenomena traditionally considered in the literature, as well as constructions that one would usually not regard as an MWE.</S>

        <S ID="S-42113">On the hand, paraphrases, as we classified them here, are transparent combinations of lexical items, like in the example below ensure that something increases.</S>
        <S ID="S-42114">However, semantically, these transparent combinations can also be rendered by an atomic expression increase.</S>
        <S ID="S-42115">A further problem raised by paraphrases is that they often involve translational shifts (<REF ID="R-03" RPTR="3">Cyrus, 2006</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-42116">These shifts are hard to identify automatically and present a general challenge for semantic processing of parallel corpora.</S>

        <S ID="S-42125">As we already observed in our analysis of general translation categories, here again, the different verb lemmas show striking differences with respect to their realization in English translations.</S>

        <S ID="S-42134">The fact that we found very few idioms in our gold standard may be simply related to our arbitrary choice of German source verbs that do not have an English idiom realization (see our experiment on a random set of verbs in Section 3.3).</S>

        <S ID="S-42137">Therefore, we will not further investigate the classification of MWE patterns in the rest of the paper, but concentrate on the highprecision detection of one-to-many translations.</S>

        <S ID="S-42293">Our manual study on a translation gold standard as well as our experiments in automatic translation extraction have shown that one-to-many correspondences provide a rich resource and fruitful basis of study for data-driven MWE identification.</S>
        <S ID="S-42294">The crosslingual perspective raises new research questions about the identification and interpretation of MWEs.</S>
        <S ID="S-42295">It challenges the distinction between paraphrases and MWEs, a problem that does not arise at all in the context of monolingual MWE extraction.</S>
        <S ID="S-42296">It also allows for the study of the relation between the semantics of lexical concepts and their MWE realization.</S>
        <S ID="S-42297">Further research in this direction should investigate translational correspondences on a larger scale and further explore these for monolingual interpretation of MWEs.</S>
        <S ID="S-42298">Our extraction method that is based on syntactic filters identifies MWE types with a much higher precision than purely cooccurence-based word alignment and captures the various patterns we found in our gold standard.</S>
        <S ID="S-42299">Future work on the extraction method will have to focus on the generalization of these filters and the generalization to other items than verbs.</S>
        <S ID="S-42300">The experiments presented in this paper also suggest that the MWE realization of certain lexical items in a target language is subject to certain linguistic patterns.</S>
        <S ID="S-42301">Moreover, the method we propose is completely languageindependent such that further research has to study the impact of the relatedness of the considered languages on the patterns of one-to-many translational correspondences.</S>
