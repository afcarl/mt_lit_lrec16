      <P>
        <S ID="S-5225">Word alignment is a critical component in training statistical machine translation systems and has received a significant amount of research, for example, (<REF ID="R-00" RPTR="0">Brown et al., 1993</REF>; <REF ID="R-08" RPTR="13">Ittycheriah and Roukos, 2005</REF>; <REF ID="R-04" RPTR="5">Fraser and Marcu, 2007</REF><REF ID="R-05" RPTR="8">Fraser and Marcu, 2007</REF>), including work leveraging syntactic parse trees, e.g., (<REF ID="R-01" RPTR="2">Cherry and Lin, 2006</REF>; <REF ID="R-02" RPTR="3">DeNero and Klein, 2007</REF>; <REF ID="R-03" RPTR="4">Fossum et al., 2008</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-5226">Word alignment is also a required first step in other algorithms such as for learning sub-sentential phrase pairs (Lavie et al., 2008) or the generation of parallel treebanks (Zhechev and Way, 2002).</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-5227">Yet word alignment precision remains surprisingly low, under 80% for state-of-the-art aligners on not closely related language pairs.</S>

        <S ID="S-5249">heuristics.</S>
        <S ID="S-5250">We can model typical word order differences between English and Arabic using English parse trees and a few Arabic-specific phrase reordering heuristics.</S>
        <S ID="S-5251">We can narrow the space of possible alignment candidates for function words using English parse trees and a few heuristics for each type of function word.</S>
        <S ID="S-5252">These heuristics have been developed using a development corpus of 100 parallel sentences.</S>

        <S ID="S-5255">Finally we present evaluations on word alignment accuracy as well as the impact on end-to-end machine translation quality.</S>

      <HEADER>2 Phase I: Content Words</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-5295">We divide the alignment process into two phases: first, we align relatively reliable content words, which in phase II we then use as a skeleton to align function words and remaining content words.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-5296">Function words such as English a, ah, all, am, an, and, any, are, as, at, ... are common words that often do not have an explicit equivalent word or words in the other side of the bitext.</S>
        <S ID="S-5297">In our system, we use a list of 96 English and 110 Arabic function words with those characteristics.</S>
        <S ID="S-5298">For the purposes of our algorithm, a word is a function word if and only if it is on the function word list for its language.</S>
        <S ID="S-5299">A content word then is defined as a word that is neither a function word nor punctuation.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-5300">The approach for aligning content words in phase I is as follows: First, we score each combination of an Arabic content word and English content word in an aligned sentence and align those pairs that pass a threshold, typically generating too many alignments.</S>
        <S ID="S-5301">Second, we compute a more comprehensive score that also takes into consideration matching alignments in the context around each alignment.</S>
        <S ID="S-5302">Third, we eliminate inferior alignments that are incompatible with higherscoring alignments.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-5303">The score in the first step is pointwise mutual information (PMI).</S>
        <S ID="S-5304">The key resource to compute this PMI is an alignment lexicon generated beforehand by a statistical word alignment system from a large bitext.</S>
        <S ID="S-5305">An alignment lexicon is a list of triples, each consisting of an English word, an Arabic word, and how often they have been aligned for a given bitext.</S>
        <S ID="S-5306">Additional counts on how often each English and Arabic word occurs allow us use this alignment lexicon to compute PMI(e,f) = log p(e;f ) .</S>
        <S ID="S-5307">We align those Arabic</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-5308">p(e)p(f )</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-5309">and English content words that have a PMI &gt; 0 and a minimum alignment lexicon count ( 10 initially).</S>
        <S ID="S-5310">Using the alignment lexicon generated by a statistical word aligner to compute PMIs is the principal statistical component in our system.</S>
        <S ID="S-5311">We explored alternative metrics such as the dicecoefficient that was used by other researchers in earlier alignment work, but found PMI to work better for our system.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-5312">In a second step, we lay a window of size 5 around each aligned pair of Arabic and English words (counting only content words) and then add to the PMI score of the link itself the PMI scores of other links within that window, with a distance weight of</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-5313">distance+1</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-5314">.</S>
        <S ID="S-5315">This yields a new score that takes into account whether a link is supported by context.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-5316">In the third step, we check for overgenerated links, comparing links that share an Arabic or an English word.</S>
        <S ID="S-5317">If a word on one side of the bitext is linked to multiple adjacent words on the other, we leave them alone, as one word in one language often corresponds to multiple words in the other.</S>
        <S ID="S-5318">However, if a word on one side is linked to nonadjacent words on the other side, this flags an incompatibility, and we remove those links that have inferior context-sensitive scores.</S>
        <S ID="S-5319">This removal is done one link at a time, with the lowest relative scores first.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-5320">We boost the process we just described in a few ways.</S>
        <S ID="S-5321">In the first alignment step, we also include as alignment candidates any content words that are string-identical on each side, such as ASCII numbers and ASCII words.</S>
        <S ID="S-5322">We finally also include as alignment candidates those word pairs that are transliterations of each other to cover rare proper names (<REF ID="R-07" RPTR="12">Hermjakob et al., 2008</REF>), which is important for language pairs that don&#8217;t share the same alphabet such as Arabic and English.</S>

        <HEADER>2.1 Reordering Using an English Parser</HEADER>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-5256">We use a refined notion of context window that models word order differences between Arabic and English.</S>
          <S ID="S-5257">Traversing a parse tree for English, we identify sub-trees for which the order in Arabic can be substantially different.</S>
          <S ID="S-5258">In Arabic, for example, the verb is often sentence-initial.</S>
          <S ID="S-5259">So for trees or subtrees identified by the parser as sentences, we generate an alternative reordering of its subtrees where the verb has been moved to the front.</S>
          <S ID="S-5260">Similarly, in a noun phrase, we generate an alternative order where adjectives are moved to the right of the noun they modify.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-5261">For example, consider the sentence John bought anewcar.</S>
          <S ID="S-5262">We can reorder its parse tree both at the sentence level: (bought) (John) (a new car) (.</S>
          <S ID="S-5263">) as well as at its object NP level: (a) (car) (new).</S>
          <S ID="S-5264">If fully enumerated, this would yield these four reordering alternatives:</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-5265">1.</S>
          <S ID="S-5266">John bought a new car .</S>
          <S ID="S-5267">2.</S>
          <S ID="S-5268">John bought a car new .</S>
          <S ID="S-5269">3. bought John a new car .</S>
          <S ID="S-5270">4. bought John a car new .</S>
          <S ID="S-5271">We don&#8217;t actually explicitly enumerate all variants but keep all reordering alternatives in a reordering forest, since the number of fully expanded reorderings grows exponentially with the number of phrases with reordering(s).</S>
          <S ID="S-5272">At the beginning of Phase I, we compute from this reordering forest a minimum distance matrix, which, for specific instances of the words John and car would record a minimum distance of 1 (based on reordering 4, skipping the function word a).</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-5273">For the example sentence at the beginning of the paper we would get reorderings including the following: Engl.</S>
          <S ID="S-5274">orig.</S>
          <S ID="S-5275">: thailand &#8217;s baradorn srichfan beat ... A reordering: beat thailand &#8217;s baradorn srichfan ... Arabic (gloss): won thai paradorn srichaphan ...</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-5276">In the above reordered English alternative, beat and thailand are next to each other, so their minimum distance is 1, which means that a link between English thailand and Arabic thai now strongly boosts the context-sensitive score between English beat and Arabic won.</S>

        <HEADER>2.2 Morphological Variation</HEADER>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-5277">Another challenge to content word alignment is morphological variation which can create data sparsity in the alignment lexicon.</S>
          <S ID="S-5278">For example, in a given bitext sentence, the Arabic word AlAw- DAE might be translated as situational,forwhich there might be no support in the alignment lexicon.</S>
          <S ID="S-5279">However the PMI between AlAwDAE and situation might be sufficiently high.</S>
          <S ID="S-5280">Additionally, there is another Arabic word, AlHAlAt, which often translates as both situation and situational.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-5281">To take advantage of such constellations, we built morphological variation lists for both Arabic and English, lists that for a given head word such as situational lists variants such as situation, and situations.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-5282">We built these lists in a one-time process by identifying superficially similar words, i.e. those that vary only with respect to an ending or a prefix, and then semantically validating such candidates using a pivot word in the other language such as AlHAlAt that has sufficiently strong alignment lexicon co-alignment counts with both situation and situational.</S>
          <S ID="S-5283">The alignment lexicon co-alignment count of an Arabic word w ar andanEnglishword</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-5284">w en is considered strong enough, if it is at least</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-5285">2.0 and at least 0.001 times as high as the highest co-alignment count of w ar with any English word; words shorter than four letters are excluded from consideration.</S>
          <S ID="S-5286">So because situation and situational are superficially similar and they are both have a strong alignment count with AlHAlAt in the alignment lexicon, situation is added to the English morphological variation list as a variant of situational and vice versa.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-5287">Exploring whether we can align situational and AlAwDAE in the bitext, we find that situational is a morphological variant of situation (based on our morphological variation list for English); next we find that based on the alignment lexicon, there is a positive PMI between situation and AlAw- DAE, which completes the chain between situational and AlAwDAE, so we include them as an alignment candidate after all.</S>
          <S ID="S-5288">The PMI of such a morphological-variation-based candidate is weighted by a &#8216;penalty&#8217; factor of 0.5 when compared with the PMI of any competing alignment candidate without such morphological-variation step.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-5289">Similarly, the English pivot word situations can be used to semantically validate the similarity between Arabic AlAwDAE and AwDAE for our Arabic morphological variation list.</S>
          <S ID="S-5290">The resulting Arabic morphological variation list has entries for 193,263 Arabic words with an average of 4.2 variants each; our English morphological variation list has 57,846 entries with 2.8 variants</S>
        </P>

        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-5292">At the end of phase I, most content words will be aligned with relatively high precision.</S>
          <S ID="S-5293">Since function words often do not have an explicit equivalent word or words in the other side of a bitext, they can not be aligned as reliably as content words based on bilingual PMI.</S>
          <S ID="S-5294">1 Note that due to data sparsity, some content words will remained unaligned in phase I and will subsequently be aligned in phase II as explained in section 3.3.</S>

      <HEADER>3 Phase II: Function Words</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-5363">In Phase II, we align function words, punctuation, and some remaining content words.</S>
        <S ID="S-5364">Function words can be classified into three categories: monovalent, divalent and independent.</S>
        <S ID="S-5365">Monovalent function words modify one head; they include articles (which modify nouns), possessive pronouns, demonstrative adjectives and auxiliary verbs.</S>
        <S ID="S-5366">Divalent function words connect two words or phrases; they include conjunctions and prepositions.</S>
        <S ID="S-5367">Independent function words include nonpossessive pronouns and copula (e.g. is as a main verb).</S>
        <S ID="S-5368">Each of these types of function words is aligned according to its own heuristics.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-5369">In this section we present three representative examples, one for articles (monovalent), one for prepositions (divalent), as well as a structural heuristic.</S>
      </P>
      <DIV DEPTH="1">
        <HEADER>3.1 Example: Articles</HEADER>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-5323">Monovalent function words have the simplest heuristics.</S>
          <S ID="S-5324">Recall that Arabic does not have articles (only a definite prefix Al- added to one or more words in a definite noun phrase), so there is usually no explicit equivalent of the English article on the Arabic side.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-5325">For an English article, our system identifies the English head word that it modifies based on the English parse tree, and then aligns it with the same Arabic word(s) which that head word is aligned with.</S>
        </P>
      </DIV>
      <DIV DEPTH="1">
        <HEADER>3.2 Example: Prepositions</HEADER>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-5326">Divalent function words are much more interesting.</S>
          <S ID="S-5327">In many cases, an English preposition corresponds to an explicit Arabic preposition in basi-</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-5328">1 It is this lack of reliability that is the defining characteristic of our function words, differentiating them from the concept of marker words used in EBMT chunking (Way and Gough, 2002).</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-5329">cally the same position.</S>
          <S ID="S-5330">Alignment in that case is straightforward.</S>
          <S ID="S-5331">However, some Arabic prepositions and even more English prepositions do not have an explicit counterpart on the other side.</S>
          <S ID="S-5332">We call such prepositions orphan prepositions.</S>
          <S ID="S-5333">The English preposition of is almost always orphaned in this way.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-5334">The decision how to align such an orphan preposition is not trivial.</S>
          <S ID="S-5335">Consider the bitext island of Basilan/jzyrp bAsylAn, a typical (NP1 (P NP2)) construction on the English side.</S>
          <S ID="S-5336">Should we co-align the preposition of with the head of NP1 or the head of NP2?</S>

      <P>
        <S ID="S-5432">Building on existing statistical aligners, our new word aligner significantly outperforms the best word aligner to date in both alignment error rate and BLEU score.</S>
        <S ID="S-5433">We have developed an approach to word alignment that combines a statistical component with linguistic heuristics.</S>
        <S ID="S-5434">It is novel in that it goes beyond generic resources such as parsers, adding heuristics to explicitly model word order differences and function word alignment.</S>
        <S ID="S-5435">The approach has numerous benefits.</S>
        <S ID="S-5436">Our system produces superior results both on alignment accuracy and end-to-end machine translation quality.</S>
        <S ID="S-5437">Alignments have a high precision.</S>
        <S ID="S-5438">The system is fast (about 0.7 seconds per sentence), and sentences are aligned individually so that a large corpus can easily be aligned on several computers in 235 parallel.</S>
        <S ID="S-5439">All alignment links are tagged with additional information, such as which phase and/or heuristic created them, yielding extensive explanatory power to the developer for easy understanding on how the system arrived at a given alignment.</S>
        <S ID="S-5440">Our approach needs and uses a parser for only one side (English) and not for the other (Arabic).</S>
        <S ID="S-5441">On the other hand, some of the components of this aligner are language-specific, such as word order heuristics, the list of specific function words, and morphological variation lists.</S>
        <S ID="S-5442">While these parts of the system need to be adapted for new languages, the overall architecture and types of heuristics and function words are languageindependent.</S>
        <S ID="S-5443">Chinese for example has different specific types of function words such as aspect markers and measure words.</S>
        <S ID="S-5444">But these fall into the existing category of monovalent function words and will be treated according the same principles as other monovalent function words (section 3.1).</S>
        <S ID="S-5445">Similarly, Japanese postpositions would be treated like other divalent function words (such as Arabic or English prepositions).</S>
        <S ID="S-5446">The author and developer has a basic knowledge of Arabic in general, and an intermediate knowledge of Arabic grammar, which means that no intimate knowledge of Arabic was required to develop the languagespecific components.</S>
        <S ID="S-5447">This same author and developer recently started to adapt UALIGN to Chinese- English word alignment.</S>
        <S ID="S-5448">The alignment rate is still somewhat low.</S>
        <S ID="S-5449">We plan to increase it by enlarging our development set beyond 100 sentences and adding further heuristics, as well as generalizing the output word alignment structure to allow alignments of words to larger constituents in a tree, and to explicitly assert that some words are not covered by the other side of a bitext to model poor translations and poor sentence alignments.</S>
