      <P>
        <S ID="S-7308">System combination aims to find consensus translations among different machine translation systems.</S>
        <S ID="S-7309">It has been proven that such consensus translations are usually better than the output of individual systems (<REF ID="R-02" RPTR="2">Frederking and Nirenburg, 1994</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-7310">In recent several years, the system combination methods based on confusion networks developed rapidly (<REF ID="R-00" RPTR="0">Bangalore et al., 2001</REF>; <REF ID="R-08" RPTR="14">Matusov et al., 2006</REF>; <REF ID="R-12" RPTR="21">Sim et al., 2007</REF>; <REF ID="R-09" RPTR="16">Rosti et al., 2007</REF>a; <REF ID="R-09" RPTR="17">Rosti et al., 2007</REF>b; <REF ID="R-11" RPTR="20">Rosti et al., 2008</REF>; <REF ID="R-03" RPTR="5">He et al., 2008</REF>), which show state-of-the-art performance in benchmarks.</S>
        <S ID="S-7311">A confusion network consists of a sequence of sets of candidate words.</S>
        <S ID="S-7312">Each candidate word is associated with a score.</S>
        <S ID="S-7313">The optimal consensus translation can be obtained by selecting one word from each set to maximizing the overall score.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-7314">To construct a confusion network, one first need to choose one of the hypotheses (i.e., candidate translations) as the backbone (also called &#8220;skeleton&#8221; in the literature) and then decide the word alignments of other hypotheses to the backbone.</S>
        <S ID="S-7315">Hypothesis alignment plays a crucial role in confusionnetwork-based system combination because it has a direct effect on selecting consensus translations.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-7316">However, a confusion network is restricted in such a way that only 1-to-1 mappings are allowed in hypothesis alignment.</S>
        <S ID="S-7317">This is not the fact even for word alignments between the same languages.</S>
        <S ID="S-7318">It is more common that several words are connected to another several words.</S>
        <S ID="S-7319">For example, &#8220;be capable of&#8221; and &#8220;be able to&#8221; have the same meaning.</S>
        <S ID="S-7320">Although confusion-network-based approaches resort to inserting null words to alleviate this problem, they face the risk of producing degenerate translations such as &#8220;be capable to&#8221; and &#8220;be able of&#8221;.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-7321">In this paper, we propose a new system combination method based on lattices.</S>
        <S ID="S-7322">As a more general form of confusion network, a lattice is capable of describing arbitrary mappings in hypothesis alignment.</S>
        <S ID="S-7323">In a lattice, each edge is associated with a sequence of words rather than a single word.</S>
        <S ID="S-7324">Therefore, we select phrases instead of words in each candidate set and minimize the chance to produce unexpected translations such as &#8220;be capable to&#8221;.</S>
        <S ID="S-7325">We compared our approach with the state-of-the-art confusion-network-based system (<REF ID="R-03" RPTR="6">He et al., 2008</REF>) and achieved a significant absolute improvement of 1.23 BLEU points on the NIST 2005 Chinese-to- English test set and 0.93 BLEU point on the NIST 2008 Chinese-to-English test set.</S>

        <P>
          <S ID="S-7342">We use an example shown in Figure 1 to illustrate our idea.</S>

        <P>
          <S ID="S-7344">We choose the first sentence as the backbone.</S>
          <S ID="S-7345">Then, we perform hypothesis alignment to build a confusion network, as shown in Figure 1(a).</S>
          <S ID="S-7346">Note that although &#8220;feels like&#8221; has the same meaning with &#8220;is fond of&#8221;, a confusion network only allows for one-to-one mappings.</S>
          <S ID="S-7347">In the confusion network shown in Figure 1(c), several null words &#949; are inserted to ensure that each hypothesis has the same length.</S>
          <S ID="S-7348">As each edge in the confusion network only has a single word, it is possible to produce inappropriate translations such as &#8220;He is like of apples&#8221;.</S>
          <S ID="S-7349">In contrast, we allow many-to-many mappings in the hypothesis alignment shown in Figure 2(b).</S>
          <S ID="S-7350">For example, &#8220;like&#8221; is aligned to three words: &#8220;is&#8221;, &#8220;fond&#8221;, and &#8220;of&#8221;.</S>
          <S ID="S-7351">Then, we use a lattice shown in Figure 1(d) to represent all possible candidate translations.</S>
          <S ID="S-7352">Note that the phrase &#8220;is fond of&#8221; is attached to an edge.</S>
          <S ID="S-7353">Now, it is unlikely to obtain a translation like &#8220;He is like of apples&#8221;.</S>

        <P>
          <S ID="S-7354">A lattice G = &#12296;V, E&#12297; is a directed acyclic graph, formally a weighted finite state automation (FSA), where V is the set of nodes and E is the set of edges.</S>
          <S ID="S-7355">The nodes in a lattice are usually labeled according to an appropriate numbering to reflect how to produce a translation.</S>

        <HEADER>6.2 Effect of Dictionary Scale</HEADER>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-7575">The dictionary is important to the semantic similarity model in IHMM-based alignment method.</S>
          <S ID="S-7576">We evaluated the effect of the dictionary scale by using dictionaries extracted on different data sets.</S>
          <S ID="S-7577">The dictionaries were respectively extracted on similar data sets: 30K sentence pairs, 60K sentence pairs, 289K sentence pairs (FBIS corpus) and 2500K sentence pairs.</S>
          <S ID="S-7578">The results are illustrated in Table 4.</S>
          <S ID="S-7579">In order to demonstrate the effect of the dictionary size clearly, the interpolation factor of similarity model was all set to &#945; = 0.1.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-7580">From Table 4, we can see that when the corpus size rise from 30k to 60k, the improvements were not obvious both on the dev set and on the test set.</S>
          <S ID="S-7581">As the corpus was expanded to 289K, although on the dev set, the result was only 0.2 BLEU point higher, on the test set, it was 0.63 BLEU point higher.</S>
          <S ID="S-7582">As the corpus size was up to 2500K, the BLEU scores both on the dev and test sets declined.</S>
          <S ID="S-7583">The reason is that, on one hand, there are more noise on the 2500K sentence pairs; on the other hand, the 289K sentence pairs cover most of the words appearing on the test set.</S>
          <S ID="S-7584">So we can conclude that in order to get better results, the dictionary scale must be up to some certain scale.</S>
          <S ID="S-7585">If the dictionary is much smaller, the result will be impacted dramatically.</S>

        <P>
          <S ID="S-7587">For the IHMM-based alignment method, the translation probability of an English word pair is computed using a linear interpolation of the semantic similarity and the surface similarity.</S>
          <S ID="S-7588">So the two similarity models decide the translation probability together and the proportion is controlled by the interpolation factor.</S>
          <S ID="S-7589">We evaluated the effect of the two similarity models by varying the interpolation factor &#945;.</S>
          <S ID="S-7590">We used the dictionaries extracted on the FBIS data set.</S>
          <S ID="S-7591">The result is shown in Table 5.</S>
          <S ID="S-7592">We got the best result with &#945; = 0.1.</S>
          <S ID="S-7593">When we excluded the semantic similarity model (&#945; = 0.0) or excluded the surface similarity model (&#945; = 1.0), the performance became worse.</S>

      <P>
        <S ID="S-7601">The alignment model plays an important role in system combination.</S>
        <S ID="S-7602">Because of the expression limitation of confusion networks, only 1-to-1 mappings are employed in the confusion-network-based model.</S>
        <S ID="S-7603">This paper proposes a lattice-based system combination model.</S>
        <S ID="S-7604">As a general form of confusion networks, lattices can express n-to-n mappings.</S>
        <S ID="S-7605">So a lattice-based model processes phrase pairs while</S>

        <S ID="S-7607">a confusion-network-based model processes words only.</S>
        <S ID="S-7608">As a result, phrase pairs must be extracted before constructing a lattice.</S>
        <S ID="S-7609">On NIST MT05 test set, the lattice-based system gave better results with an absolute improvement of 1.23 BLEU points over the confusionnetwork-based system (<REF ID="R-03" RPTR="9">He et al., 2008</REF>) and 3.73 BLEU points over the best single system.</S>
        <S ID="S-7610">On NIST MT08 test set, the lattice-based system outperformed the confusion-network-based system by 0.93 BLEU point and outperformed the best single system by 3.0 BLEU points.</S>
