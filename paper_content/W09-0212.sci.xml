      <P>
        <S ID="S-40427">This paper describes a cross-linguistic experiment which attempts to extend a given translation dictionary with translations of novel words.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-40428">In our experiment, we use an English and a German text corpus and represent each corpus as a graph whose nodes are words and whose edges represent grammatical relationships between words.</S>
        <S ID="S-40429">The corpora need not be parallel.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-40430">Our intuition is that a node in the English and a node in the German graph are similar (that is, are likely to be translations of one another), if their neighboring nodes are.</S>
        <S ID="S-40431">Figure 1 shows part of the English and the German word graph.</S>
        <S ID="S-40432">Many of the (first and higher order) neighbors of food and Lebensmittel translate to one another (marked by dotted lines), indicating that food and Lebensmittel, too, are likely mutual translations.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-40433">Our hypothesis yields a recursive algorithm for computing node similarities based on the similarities of the nodes they are connected to.</S>
        <S ID="S-40434">We initialize the node similarities using an English- German dictionary whose entries correspond to known pairs of equivalent nodes (words).</S>
        <S ID="S-40435">These node equivalences constitute the &#8220;seeds&#8221; from which novel English-German node (word) correspondences are bootstrapped.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-40436">We are not aware of any previous work using a measure of similarity between nodes in graphs for cross-lingual lexicon acquisition.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-40437">Our approach is appealing in that it is language independent, easily implemented and visualized, and readily generalized to other types of data.</S>
        <S ID="S-40438">Section 2 is dedicated to related research on the automatic extension of translation lexicons.</S>
        <S ID="S-40439">In Section 3 we review SimRank (<REF ID="R-01" RPTR="1">Jeh and Widom, 2002</REF>), an algorithm for computing similarities of nodes in a graph, which forms the basis of our work.</S>
        <S ID="S-40440">We provide a formulation of SimRank in terms of simple matrix operations which allows an efficient implementation using optimized matrix packages.</S>
        <S ID="S-40441">We further present a generalization of SimRank to edge-weighted and edge-labeled graphs and to inter-graph node comparison.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-40442">Section 4 describes the process used for building the word graphs.</S>
        <S ID="S-40443">Section 5 presents an experiment for evaluating our approach to bilingual lexicon acquisition.</S>
        <S ID="S-40444">Section 6 reports the results.</S>

        <S ID="S-40446">The work by <REF ID="R-04" RPTR="6">Rapp (1999)</REF> is driven by the idea that a word and its translation to another language are likely to co-occur with similar words.</S>
        <S ID="S-40447">Given a German and an English corpus, he computes two word-by-word co-occurrence matrices, one for each language, whose columns span a vector space representing the corresponding corpus.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-40448">In order to find the English translation of a German word, he uses a base dictionary to translate all known column labels to English.</S>
        <S ID="S-40449">This yields a new vector representation of the German word in the English vector space.</S>
        <S ID="S-40450">This mapped vector is then compared to all English word vectors, the most similar ones being candidate translations.</S>

        <S ID="S-40454">Their challenge then is to derive a mapping from one language to the other (i.e. a translation lexicon) which best preserves the intra-language word similarities.</S>
        <S ID="S-40455">The mapping is initialized with a few seed &#8220;translations&#8221; (punctuation marks) which are assumed to be common to both corpora.</S>
        <S ID="S-40456">They test their method on two corpora written in the same language and report accuracy rates of over 90% on this pseudo-translation task.</S>
        <S ID="S-40457">The approach is attractive in that it does not require a seed lexicon.</S>
        <S ID="S-40458">A drawback is its high computational cost.</S>

        <S ID="S-40465">English and Spanish vectors thus reside in the same vector space and are readily compared.</S>

      <P>
        <S ID="S-40571">The aim of our evaluation experiment is to test the extended SimRank algorithm for its ability to identify novel word translations given the English and German word graph of the previous section and an English-German seed lexicon.</S>
        <S ID="S-40572">We use the dict.cc English-German dictionary 1 .</S>
        <S ID="S-40573">Our evaluation strategy is as follows.</S>
        <S ID="S-40574">We select a set of test words at random from among the words listed in the dictionary, and remove their entries from the dictionary.</S>
        <S ID="S-40575">We run six iterations of SimRank using the remaining dictionary entries as the seed translations (the known node equivalences), and record the similarities of each test word to its known translations.</S>

        <S ID="S-40590">Most of the 10 top-ranked candidate translations of sanction are hyponyms of the correct translations.</S>
        <S ID="S-40591">This is mainly due to insufficient noun compound analysis.</S>
        <S ID="S-40592">Both the English and German nouns in our graph model are single words.</S>
        <S ID="S-40593">Whereas the English nouns consist only of head nouns, the German nouns include many compounds (as they are written without spaces), and thus tend to be more specific.</S>
        <S ID="S-40594">Some of the top candidate translations of delay are correct (verschieben) or at least acceptable (vertagen), but do not count as such as they are missing in the gold standard dictionary.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-40595">The mistranslation of the German noun Kosten is due to semantic ambiguity.</S>
        <S ID="S-40596">Kosten co-occurs often with the verb tragen as in to bear costs.</S>
        <S ID="S-40597">The verb tragen however is ambiguous and may as well be translated as to wear which is strongly associated with clothes.</S>
        <S ID="S-40598">We find several antonyms of &#246;ffnen among its top predicted translations.</S>
        <S ID="S-40599">Verb-object relationships alone do not suffice to distinguish synonyms from antonyms.</S>
        <S ID="S-40600">Similarly, it is extremely difficult to differentiate between the members of closed categories (e.g. the days of the week, months of the year, mass and time units) using only syntactic relationships.</S>

      <P>
        <S ID="S-40601">The matrix formulation of the SimRank algorithm given in this paper allows an implementation using efficient off-the-shelf software libraries for matrix computation.</S>
        <S ID="S-40602">We presented an extension of the SimRank algorithm to edge-weighted and edge-labeled graphs.</S>
        <S ID="S-40603">We further generalized the SimRank equations to permit the comparison of nodes from two different graphs, and proposed an application to bilingual lexicon induction.</S>
        <S ID="S-40604">Our system is not yet accurate enough to be used for actual compilation of translation dictionaries.</S>
        <S ID="S-40605">We further need to address the problem of data sparsity.</S>
        <S ID="S-40606">In particular, we need to remove the bias towards low-degree words whose similarities to other words are unduly high.</S>
        <S ID="S-40607">In order to solve the problem of ambiguity, we intend to apply SimRank to the incidence representation of the word graphs, which is constructed by putting a node on each link.</S>
        <S ID="S-40608">The proposed algorithm will then naturally return similarities between the more sense-discriminative links (syntactic relationships) in addition to similarities between the often ambiguous nodes (isolated words).</S>
