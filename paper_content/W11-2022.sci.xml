      <P>
        <S ID="S-46046">Discourse connectives are generally considered as indicators of discourse structure, relating two sentences of a written or spoken text, and making explicit the rhetorical or coherence relation between them.</S>
        <S ID="S-46047">Leaving aside the cases when connectives are only implicit, the presence of a connective does not unambiguously signal a specific discourse relation.</S>
        <S ID="S-46048">In fact, many connectives can indicate several types of relations between sentences, i.e. they have several possible &#8220;senses&#8221; in context.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-46049">This paper studies the manual and automated disambiguation of three ambiguous connectives in two languages: alors que in French, since and while in English.</S>
        <S ID="S-46050">We will show how the multilingual perspective helps to improve the accuracy of annotation, and how it helps to find appropriate labels for automated processing and MT.</S>
        <S ID="S-46051">Results from automatic annotation experiments, which are close to the state of the art, as well as feature analysis, help to assess the usefulness of the proposed labels.</S>

        <HEADER>2.1 Three Multi-functional Connectives</HEADER>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-46058">Discourse connectives form a functional category of lexical items that are used to mark coherence relations such as Cause or Contrast between units of discourse.</S>
          <S ID="S-46059">Along with other function words, many connectives appear among the most frequent words, as shown for instance by counts (<REF ID="R-00" RPTR="0">Cartoni et al., 2011</REF>) over the Europarl corpus (<REF ID="R-08" RPTR="8">Koehn, 2005</REF>).</S>
          <S ID="S-46060">The Penn Discourse Treebank (<REF ID="R-19" RPTR="29">Prasad et al., 2008</REF>) (see Section 3.1 below) includes around 100 connective types, but the exact number varies across studies,</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-46061">depending on the discourse theory used to classify them.</S>
          <S ID="S-46062">Among these types, Pitler et al.(2008) have shown that most of them are unambiguous and easy to identify, but others, especially temporal ones, often signal multiple senses depending on their context.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-46063">Following the terminology of <REF ID="R-16" RPTR="26">Petukhova and Bunt (2009</REF>, Section 2), we are interested here in &#8220;sequential&#8221; multi-functionality, i.e. the fact that the same connective can signal different relations in different contexts.</S>
          <S ID="S-46064">We do not deal with &#8220;simultaneous&#8221; multi-functionality, i.e. the possibility for a single occurrence to signal several relations, which has been less frequently studied for connectives (see <REF ID="R-16" RPTR="27">Petukhova and Bunt (2009</REF>) for the discourse usage of and).</S>
          <S ID="S-46065">We identified the two English connectives while and since, along with the French connective alors que, as being particularly problematic because they are highly multi-functional, i.e. they can signal multiple senses.</S>
          <S ID="S-46066">For alors que, a French database of connectives (LexConn (<REF ID="R-20" RPTR="31">Roze et al., 2010</REF>), see Section 3 below) contains examples of sentences where alors que expresses either a Background or a Contrast relation.</S>
          <S ID="S-46067">For the English connective since, <REF ID="R-13" RPTR="17">Miltsakaki et al. (2005)</REF> identified three possible meanings: Temporal, Causal, and simultaneously Temporal/Causal.</S>
          <S ID="S-46068">For while, even more senses are observed: Comparison, Contrast, Concession, and Opposition.</S>
          <S ID="S-46069">In fact, in the Penn Discourse Treebank, the connective while is annotated with more than twenty different senses.</S>

        <P>
          <S ID="S-46070">Our long-term goal is to identify automatically the senses of connectives for an application to machine translation (MT).</S>
          <S ID="S-46071">Going beyond the labels provided by discourse theories, the goal is thus to find the most appropriate labels in a new multilingual, empirical approach that makes use of parallel corpora to annotate and then learn the various senses of connectives.</S>
          <S ID="S-46072">The disambiguation of such connectives in a source text is crucial for its translation, because each sense may be translated by a different connective and/or syntactical construct in the target language.</S>
          <S ID="S-46073">More specifically, we hypothesize that correctly labeled connectives are easier to learn and to translate by statistical MT systems than unlabeled ones.</S>
          <S ID="S-46074">To support this hypothesis, we set up an experiment (<REF ID="R-11" RPTR="15">Meyer, 2011</REF>) in which we constrained the translation of the three senses of the discourse connective while that were previously annotated as Temporal, Contrast and Concession.</S>
          <S ID="S-46075">The system was forced to use predefined French translations known to be correct, by directly modifying the phrase table of the trained MT system.</S>

          <S ID="S-46093">When an ambiguous connective is explicitly translated by another connective, the incorrect rendering of its sense can lead to erroneous translations, as in the second and third examples in Table 1, which are translated by the Moses SMT decoder (<REF ID="R-07" RPTR="7">Koehn et al., 2007</REF>) trained on the Europarl corpus.</S>
          <S ID="S-46094">The reference translation for the second example uses the French connective car with a correct causal sense, instead of the wrong depuis que generated by SMT, which expresses a temporal relation.</S>
          <S ID="S-46095">In the third example, the French connective alors que, in its contrastive usage, is wrongly translated into the English connective so, which has a causal meaning (the reference translation uses whereas to express contrast).</S>
          <S ID="S-46096">It may even occur that the system fails to translate a connective at all, as in the fourth example where the discourse information provided by while, namely a Contrast relation, is lost in the French translation, which is hardly coherent any longer.</S>

          <S ID="S-46116">The first approach is to label each occurrence of a connective with a label for its sense, similar to the PDTB or LexConn hierarchies of senses.</S>
          <S ID="S-46117">However, as shown among others by Zikanova et al. (2010), this is a difficult and timeconsuming task even when the annotators are trained over a long period of time.</S>
          <S ID="S-46118">This is confirmed by the rather low kappa scores resulting from the manual sense annotations as can be seen for each connective in detail below.</S>

        <P>
          <S ID="S-46119">The second approach to annotation, which is the one put forward in this paper, is based on translation spotting.</S>
          <S ID="S-46120">In a first step, human annotators work on bilingual sentence pairs, and annotate the translation of each connective in the target language.</S>
          <S ID="S-46121">The translations are either a target language connective (signaling in principle the same sense(s) as the source one), or a reformulation, or a construct with no connective at all.</S>
          <S ID="S-46122">In a second step of the annotation, all translations of a connective are manually clustered by the experimenters to derive sense labels, by grouping together similar translations.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-46123">As demonstrated in the following subsections, for the three connectives under study, the second approach to connective annotation not only facilitates the annotation task, but also helps to derive the appropriate level of granularity for the sense labels.</S>

          <S ID="S-46149">In the PDTB, occurrences of while are annotated with no less than 21 possible senses, ranging from Conjunction to Contrast, Concession, or Synchrony.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-46150">We performed a pilot annotation of 30 sentences containing while with five different experimenters, resulting in a quite low inter-annotator agreement, &#954; = 0.56.</S>
          <S ID="S-46151">We therefore decided to perform a translation spotting task only, with two experienced annotators fluent in English and French.</S>
          <S ID="S-46152">The observed translations into French confirm the ambiguity of while, as they include several connectives and constructs, quite evenly distributed in terms of frequency: alors que, gerundive reformulations, other reformulations, si, tandis que, m&#234;me si, bien que, etc.</S>
          <S ID="S-46153">The translations were manually clustered to derive senses for while, in an empirical manner.</S>
          <S ID="S-46154">For example, alors que signals Temporal/Contrast, which is also true for tandis que.</S>
          <S ID="S-46155">Similarly, m&#234;me si and bien que are clustered under the label Concession, and so forth.</S>
          <S ID="S-46156">The translation spotting shows that at least Contrast, Concession, and several temporal senses are necessary to account for a correct translation.</S>
          <S ID="S-46157">These distinctions are comparable to the semantic granularity of the second PDTB hierarchy level.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-46158">To generate training sets for automated classification out of a total of 500 sentences, we discarded 201 sentences labeled by annotators with G (gerundive constructions), P (reformulations) or Z (no translation at all) &#8211; these cases could be reconsidered in further work, as they represent valid translation problems.</S>
          <S ID="S-46159">For the remaining 299 sentences, we created the following six labels by clustering the spotted translations: T/C (Temporal/Contrast), T/PUNCT (Temporal/Punctual), T/DUR (Temporal/Duration), T/CAUSAL (Temporal/Causal), CONC (Concession) and C (Contrast).</S>

          <S ID="S-46169">The English texts were parsed and POS-tagged by Charniak and Johnson&#8217;s (2005) reranking parser.</S>
          <S ID="S-46170">The French texts were POS-tagged with the MElt tagger (<REF ID="R-02" RPTR="2">Denis and Sagot, 2009</REF>) and parsed with MaltParser (<REF ID="R-14" RPTR="25">Nivre, 2003</REF>).</S>
          <S ID="S-46171">As the English parser provides constituency trees, and the parser for French generates dependency trees, the features are slightly different in the two languages.</S>
          <S ID="S-46172">The other features below were extracted using elementary pre-processing of the sentences.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-46173">For English sentences, we used the following features: the sentence-initial character of the connec-</S>

          <S ID="S-46175">For French sentences, the features were the following: the sentence-initial character of the connective (yes/no); the dependency tag of the connective; the first verb in the sentence; its dependency tag; the word preceding the connective; its POS tag; its dependency tag; the word following the connective; its POS tag; its dependency tag; the first verb after the connective; its dependency tag.</S>
          <S ID="S-46176">The cased connective word forms from the corpus were not lower-cased, thus keeping the implicit indication of the sentence-initial character of the occurrence, i.e. whether it starts a sentence or not.</S>
          <S ID="S-46177">The output of the POS taggers was used for neighboring words, but not for the connectives, which almost always received the same tag.</S>
          <S ID="S-46178">Charniak&#8217;s parser for English provides POS tags which differentiate the verb tenses, such as VBD (past), VBG (gerund), and so on.</S>
          <S ID="S-46179">These were considered for the verb directly preceding and the one directly following the connective.</S>
          <S ID="S-46180">Tense was believed to be potentially relevant because since and while can have temporal meanings.</S>
          <S ID="S-46181">The occurrence of auxiliary verbs (be, have, do, or need) may give additional indications about temporal relations in the sentence.</S>
          <S ID="S-46182">We therefore used the types of auxiliary verbs as features, including the elementary conjugations, represented for to be as: be present, be past, be part, be inf, be gerund &#8211; and similarly for the other auxiliary verbs, as in (<REF ID="R-13" RPTR="24">Miltsakaki et al., 2005</REF>).</S>

          <S ID="S-46188">In contrast to constituents, dependency structures contain information about the grammatical function of each word (heads) and link the dependents belonging to the same head.</S>
          <S ID="S-46189">However, as the dependency parser provides no differentiated verb tags, we extracted the verb word forms themselves and added their dependency tags.</S>
          <S ID="S-46190">The same applies to the connective itself, and preceding and following words and their dependency tags.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-46191">The dependency tag of the non-connectives varies between subj (subject), det (determiner), mod (modifier) and obj (object).</S>
          <S ID="S-46192">The first verb in the sentence often belongs to the root dependency while the verb following the connective most often belongs to the obj dependency.</S>
          <S ID="S-46193">For alors que, the most frequent dependency tags were mod mod and mod obj, indicating the connective&#8217;s main function as a modifier of its argument.</S>

          <S ID="S-46208">The analysis of results for each data sets leads to observations that are specific to each connective.</S>
          <S ID="S-46209">The high improvement of over the baseline for A1, as opposed to no improvement for A2, confirms the usefulness of the double-sense B/C label for alors que, showing that in this case the three-way classification is probably better adapted to the linguistic properties of alors que than a two-way classification.</S>
          <S ID="S-46210">Indeed, alors que, just as its frequently spotted translation while, is linguistically ambiguous in some contexts (see for instance the example in Section 4.2), in which the temporal and the contrastive meaning are likely to co-exist.</S>
          <S ID="S-46211">In the case of A2, where the labels were forced to B or C only, automatic classifiers do not significantly outperform the baseline.</S>
          <S ID="S-46212">While more elaborate features might help, these low scores can be related to the difficulties of human annotators (Section 4.2), and make a strong case against using a two-label schema for alors que.</S>

      <P>
        <S ID="S-46237">We have described a translation-oriented approach to the manual and automatic annotation of discourse connectives, with the goal of identifying their senses automatically, prior to machine translation.</S>
        <S ID="S-46238">The manual annotation of the senses of connectives has been enhanced through parallel corpora and translation spotting.</S>
        <S ID="S-46239">This has lead to tag sets that improved both inter-annotator agreement and automatic labeling, which reached state-of-the-art scores.</S>
        <S ID="S-46240">The analysis of relevant features has shown the utility of contextual information.</S>
        <S ID="S-46241">To improve over these initial results, we will use more semantic information, such as relations found in WordNet between words in the neighborhood of connectives &#8211; e.g. word similarity measures and semantic relations such as antonymy.</S>
        <S ID="S-46242">To generate more training instances of the labels found, manual annotation will continue in order to see whether the senses found through translation spotting can improve automatic disambiguation of many more connectives.</S>
        <S ID="S-46243">The annotation of a large parallel corpus will then help to train disambiguation tools along with statistical MT systems that use their output.</S>
