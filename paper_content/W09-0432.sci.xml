  <ABSTRACT>
    <A-S ID="S-40820">Domain adaptation has recently gained interest in statistical machine translation to cope with the performance drop observed when testing conditions deviate from training conditions.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-40821">The basic idea is that in-domain training data can be exploited to adapt all components of an already developed system.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-40822">Previous work showed small performance gains by adapting from limited in-domain bilingual data.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-40823">Here, we aim instead at significant performance gains by exploiting large but cheap monolingual in-domain data, either in the source or in the target language.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-40824">We propose to synthesize a bilingual corpus by translating the monolingual adaptation data into the counterpart language.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-40825">Investigations were conducted on a stateof-the-art phrase-based system trained on the Spanish&#8211;English part of the UN corpus, and adapted on the corresponding Europarl data.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-40826">Translation, re-ordering, and language models were estimated after translating in-domain texts with the baseline.</A-S>

      <HEADER>1 Introduction</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-40828">A well-known problem of Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) is that performance quickly degrades as soon as testing conditions deviate from training conditions.</S>
        <S ID="S-40829">The very simple reason is that the underlying statistical models always tend to closely approximate the empirical distributions of the training data, which typically consist of bilingual texts and monolingual target-language texts.</S>
        <S ID="S-40830">The former provide a means to learn likely translations pairs, the latter to form correct sentences with translated words.</S>
        <S ID="S-40831">Besides the general difficulties of language translation, which we do not consider here, there are two aspects that make machine learning of this task particularly hard.</S>
        <S ID="S-40832">First, human language has intrinsically very sparse statistics at the surface level, hence gaining complete knowledge on translation phrase pairs or target language n-grams is almost impractical.</S>
        <S ID="S-40833">Second, language is highly variable with respect to several dimensions, style, genre, domain, topics, etc.</S>
        <S ID="S-40834">Even apparently small differences in domain might result in significant deviations in the underlying statistical models.</S>
        <S ID="S-40835">While data sparseness corroborates the need of large language samples in SMT, linguistic variability would indeed suggest to consider many alternative data sources as well.</S>
        <S ID="S-40836">By rephrasing a famous saying we could say that &#8220;no data is better than more and assorted data&#8221;.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-40837">The availability of language resources for SMT has dramatically increased over the last decade, at least for a subset of relevant languages and especially for what concerns monolingual corpora.</S>
        <S ID="S-40838">Unfortunately, the increase in quantity has not gone in parallel with an increase in assortment, especially for what concerns the most valuable resource, that is bilingual corpora.</S>
        <S ID="S-40839">Large parallel data available to the research community are for the moment limited to texts produced by international organizations (European Parliament, United Nations, Canadian Hansard), press agencies, and technical manuals.</S>
        <S ID="S-40840">The limited availability of parallel data poses challenging questions regarding the portability of SMT across different application domains and language pairs, and its adaptability with respect to language variability within the same application domain.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-40841">This work focused on the second issue, namely the adaptation of a Spanish-to-English phrasebased SMT system across two apparently close domains: the United Nation corpus and the Euro-</S>

      <P>
        <S ID="S-40842">pean Parliament corpus.</S>
        <S ID="S-40843">Cross-domain adaptation is faced under the assumption that only monolingual texts are available, either in the source language or in the target language.</S>
        <S ID="S-40844">The paper is organized as follows.</S>
        <S ID="S-40845">Section 2 presents previous work on the problem of adaptation in SMT; Section 3 introduces the exemplar task and research questions we addressed; Section 4 describes the SMT system and the adaptation techniques that were investigated; Section 5 presents and discusses experimental results; and Section 6 provides conclusions.</S>

      <P>
        <S ID="S-40846">Domain adaptation in SMT has been investigated only recently.</S>
        <S ID="S-40847">In (<REF ID="R-02" RPTR="2">Eck et al., 2004</REF>) adaptation is limited to the target language model (LM).</S>
        <S ID="S-40848">The background LM is combined with one estimated on documents retrieved from the WEB by using the input sentence as query and applying crosslanguage information retrieval techniques.</S>
        <S ID="S-40849">Refinements of this approach are described in (<REF ID="R-16" RPTR="18">Zhao et al., 2004</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-40850">In (<REF ID="R-07" RPTR="6">Hildebrand et al., 2005</REF>) information retrieval techniques are applied to retrieve sentence pairs from the training corpus that are relevant to the test sentences.</S>
        <S ID="S-40851">Both the language and the translation models are retrained on the extracted data.</S>
        <S ID="S-40852">In (<REF ID="R-06" RPTR="5">Foster and Kuhn, 2007</REF>) two basic settings are investigated: cross-domain adaptation, in which a small sample of parallel in-domain text is assumed, and dynamic adaptation, in which only the current input source text is considered.</S>
        <S ID="S-40853">Adaptation relies on mixture models estimated on the training data through some unsupervised clustering method.</S>
        <S ID="S-40854">Given available adaptation data, mixture weights are re-estimated ad-hoc.</S>
        <S ID="S-40855">A variation of this approach was also recently proposed in (<REF ID="R-05" RPTR="4">Finch and Sumita, 2008</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-40856">In (<REF ID="R-01" RPTR="1">Civera and Juan, 2007</REF>) mixture models are instead employed to adapt a word alignment model to in-domain parallel data.</S>
        <S ID="S-40857">In (<REF ID="R-08" RPTR="7">Koehn and Schroeder, 2007</REF>) cross-domain adaptation techniques were applied on a phrasebased SMT trained on the Europarl task, in order to translate news commentaries, from French to English.</S>
        <S ID="S-40858">In particular, a small portion of indomain bilingual data was exploited to adapt the Europarl language model and translation models by means of linear interpolation techniques.</S>
        <S ID="S-40859"><REF ID="R-15" RPTR="17">Ueffing et al. (2007)</REF> proposed several elaborate adaptation methods relying on additional bilingual data synthesized from the development or test set.</S>
        <S ID="S-40860">Our work is mostly related to (<REF ID="R-08" RPTR="8">Koehn and Schroeder, 2007</REF>) but explores different assumptions about available adaptation data: i.e. only monolingual in-domain texts are available.</S>
        <S ID="S-40861">The adaptation of the translation and re-ordering models is performed by generating synthetic bilingual data from monolingual texts, similarly to what proposed in (<REF ID="R-14" RPTR="16">Schwenk, 2008</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-40862">Interpolation of multiple phrase tables is applied in a more principled way than in (<REF ID="R-08" RPTR="9">Koehn and Schroeder, 2007</REF>): all entries are merged into one single table, corresponding feature functions are concatenated and smoothing is applied when observations are missing.</S>
        <S ID="S-40863">The approach proposed in this paper has many similarities with the simplest technique in (Ueffing et al., 2007), but it is applied to a much larger monolingual corpus.</S>
        <S ID="S-40864">Finally, with respect to previous work we also investigate the behavior of the minimum error training procedure to optimize the combination of feature functions on a small in-domain bilingual sample.</S>

      <HEADER>3 Task description</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-40865">This paper addresses the issue of adapting an already developed phrase-based translation system in order to work properly on a different domain, for which almost no parallel data are available but only monolingual texts.</S>

      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-40867">The main components of the SMT system are the translation model, which aims at porting the content from the source to the target language, and the language model, which aims at building fluent sentences in the target language.</S>
        <S ID="S-40868">While the former is trained with bilingual data, the latter just needs monolingual target texts.</S>
        <S ID="S-40869">In this work, a lexicalized re-ordering model is also exploited to control re-ordering of target words.</S>
        <S ID="S-40870">This model is also learnable from parallel data.</S>
        <S ID="S-40871">Assuming some large monolingual in-domain texts are available, two basic adaptation approaches are pursued here: (i) generating synthetic bilingual data with an available SMT system and use this data to adapt its translation and re-ordering models; (ii) using synthetic or provided target texts to also, or only, adapt its language model.</S>

        <S ID="S-40941">The investigation presented in this paper was carried out with the Moses toolkit (<REF ID="R-09" RPTR="10">Koehn et al., 2007</REF>), a state-of-the-art open-source phrase-based SMT system.</S>
        <S ID="S-40942">We trained Moses in a standard configuration, including a 4-feature translation model, a 7-feature lexicalized re-ordering model, one LM, word and phrase penalties.</S>
        <S ID="S-40943">The translation and the re-ordering model relied on &#8220;grow-diag-final&#8221; symmetrized word-toword alignments built using GIZA++ (<REF ID="R-12" RPTR="13">Och and Ney, 2003</REF>) and the training script of Moses.</S>
        <S ID="S-40944">A 5-gram language model was trained on the target side of the training parallel corpus using the IRSTLM toolkit (<REF ID="R-04" RPTR="3">Federico et al., 2008</REF>), exploiting Modified Kneser-Ney smoothing, and quantizing both probabilities and backoff weights.</S>
        <S ID="S-40945">Decoding was performed applying cube-pruning with a poplimit of 6000 hypotheses.</S>

          <S ID="S-40888">Recently, we enhanced Moses decoder to also output the word-to-word alignment between the input sentence and its translation, given that they have been added to the phrase table at training time.</S>
          <S ID="S-40889">Notice that the additional information introduces an overhead in disk usage of about 70%, but practically no overhead at decoding time.</S>
          <S ID="S-40890">However, when training translation and re-ordering models from synthetic data generated by the decoder, this feature allows to completely skip the time-expensive step 1.</S>

          <S ID="S-40893">With respect to the standard procedure, the total training time was reduced by almost 50%, phrase extraction produced 10% more phrase pairs, and the final translation system showed a loss in translation performance (BLEU score) below 1% relative.</S>

        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-40905">In the first phase of the decoding process, Moses generates translation options for all possible input phrases &#732;f through a lookup into S; it simply extracts alternative phrase pairs ( &#732;f, &#7869;) for a specific &#732;f and optionally applies pruning (based on the feature values and weights) to limit the number of such pairs.</S>
          <S ID="S-40906">In the second phase of decoding, it creates translation hypotheses of the full input sentence by combining in all possible ways (satisfying given re-ordering constraints) the prefetched translation options.</S>
          <S ID="S-40907">In this phase the hypotheses are scored, according to all features functions, ranked, and possibly pruned.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-40908">When more TMs S j are available, Moses can behave in two different ways in pre-fetching the translation options.</S>
          <S ID="S-40909">It searches a given &#732;f in all sets and keeps a phrase pair ( &#732;f, &#7869;) if it belongs to either i) their intersection or ii) their union.</S>
          <S ID="S-40910">The former method corresponds to building one new TM S I , whose set is the intersection of all given sets:</S>

        <P>
          <S ID="S-40916">Again, the set of features of the new TM is the union of the features of all single TMs; but for a phrase pair ( &#732;f, &#7869;) belonging to S U \S j , the feature values h( &#732;f, &#7869;; S j ) are undefined.</S>
          <S ID="S-40917">In these undefined situations, Moses provides a default value of 0, which is the highest available score, as the feature values come from probabilistic distributions and are expressed as logarithms.</S>

          <S ID="S-40998">Configurations exploiting the small development set (c,d) show a slower and more unstable convergence; however, their final performance in Table 3 result only slightly lower than that obtained with the standard dev sets (a, b).</S>
          <S ID="S-40999">Due to the larger number of iterations they needed, both configurations are indeed more time consuming than the intermediate configuration (b), which seems the best one.</S>
          <S ID="S-41000">In conclusion, we found that the size of the n-best list has essentially no effect on the quality of the final weights, but it impacts significantly on the computational time.</S>

      <P>
        <S ID="S-41033">This paper investigated cross-domain adaptation of a state-of-the-art SMT system (Moses), by exploiting large but cheap monolingual data.</S>
        <S ID="S-41034">We proposed to generate synthetic parallel data by 188 translating monolingual adaptation data with a background system and to train statistical models from the synthetic corpus.</S>
        <S ID="S-41035">We found that the largest gain (25% relative) is achieved when in-domain data are available for the target language.</S>
        <S ID="S-41036">A smaller performance improvement is still observed (5% relative) if source adaptation data are available.</S>
        <S ID="S-41037">We also observed that the most important role is played by the LM adaptation, while the adaptation of the TM and RM gives consistent but small improvement.</S>
        <S ID="S-41038">We also showed that a very tiny development set of only 200 parallel sentences is adequate enough to get comparable performance as a 2000-sentence set.</S>
        <S ID="S-41039">Finally, we described how to reduce the time for training models from a synthetic corpus generated through Moses by 50% at least, by exploiting word-alignment information provided during decoding.</S>
