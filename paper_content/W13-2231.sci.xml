      <P>
        <S ID="S-53451">With the steady progress in the field of Statistical Machine Translation (SMT), the translation industry is now faced with the possibility of significant productivity increases (i.e. amount of publishable output per unit of time).</S>
        <S ID="S-53452">One way to achieve this goal, in Computer Assisted Translation (CAT) environments, is the integration of (precise, but often partial) suggestions obtained through &#8220;fuzzy matches&#8221; from a Translation Memory (TM), with (complete, but potentially less precise) translations produced by an MT system.</S>
        <S ID="S-53453">Such integration can loosely consist in presenting translators with unranked suggestions obtained from the MT and the TM, or rely on tighter combination strategies.</S>

      <P>
        <S ID="S-53455">instance, MT and TM translations can be automatically ranked to ease the selection of the most suitable one for post-editing (He et al., 2010), or the TM can be used to constrain and improve MT suggestions (Ma et al., 2011).</S>
        <S ID="S-53456">In all cases, the effectiveness of the integration is conditioned by: i) the quality of MT, and ii) the accuracy in automatically predicting such quality.</S>
        <S ID="S-53457">Higher productivity increases depend on the capability of the MT system to output useful material that is close to be publishable &#8220;as is&#8221; (<REF ID="R-08" RPTR="8">Denkowski and Lavie, 2012</REF>), and the capability to automatically identify and present to human translators only such suggestions.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-53458">Recognizing good translations falls in the scope of research on automatic MT Quality Estimation (QE), which addresses the problem of estimating the quality of a translated sentence at run-time, without access to reference translations (<REF ID="R-25" RPTR="26">Specia et al., 2009</REF>; <REF ID="R-23" RPTR="24">Soricut and Echihabi, 2010</REF>; <REF ID="R-00" RPTR="0">Bach et al., 2011</REF>; <REF ID="R-28" RPTR="32">Specia, 2011</REF>; <REF ID="R-16" RPTR="14">Mehdad et al., 2012</REF><REF ID="R-17" RPTR="16">Mehdad et al., 2012</REF>b).</S>
        <S ID="S-53459">In recent years QE gained increasing interest in the MT community, resulting in several datasets available for training and evaluation (<REF ID="R-04" RPTR="4">Callison-Burch et al., 2012</REF>), the definition of features showing good correlation with human judgements (<REF ID="R-24" RPTR="25">Soricut et al., 2012</REF>), and the release of open-source software.</S>

      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-53461">The proposed solutions to the QE problem rely on supervised methods that strongly depend on the availability of labelled data.</S>
        <S ID="S-53462">While early works (<REF ID="R-03" RPTR="3">Blatz et al., 2003</REF>) exploited annotations obtained with automatic MT evaluation metrics like BLEU (<REF ID="R-18" RPTR="18">Papineni et al., 2002</REF>), the current trend is to rely on human annotations, which seem to lead to more accurate models (<REF ID="R-21" RPTR="21">Quirk, 2004</REF>; <REF ID="R-25" RPTR="27">Specia et al., 2009</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-53463">Along this direction, the QE task consists in predicting scores that reflect human quality judgements, by learning from manually annotated datasets (e.g. collections of source-target pairs la-</S>

        <S ID="S-53466">Within this dominant supervised framework, we explore different ways to obtain labelled data for training a binary QE classifier suitable for integration in a CAT tool.</S>
        <S ID="S-53467">Since, to the best of our knowledge, labelled data with binary judgements are currently not available, we consider two alternative options.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-53468">The first option is to adapt an existing dataset, checking whether it can be partitioned in a way that reflects the distinction between good (useful for the translator, suitable for post editing) and bad translations (that need complete rewriting).</S>
        <S ID="S-53469">2 To this aim we experiment with the QE data released within the 7 th Workshop on Machine Translation (WMT-12).</S>
        <S ID="S-53470">The corpus consists of source-target pairs annotated with manual QE labels (1-5 scores) indicating the post-editing needed to correct the translations.</S>
        <S ID="S-53471">Besides explicit human judgements, the availability of post-edited translations makes also possible to calculate the actual HTER values (<REF ID="R-22" RPTR="23">Snover et al., 2009</REF>), indicating the minimum edit distance between the machine translation and its manually post-edited version in the [0,1] interval.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-53472">The second option is to automatically reannotate the same dataset, trying to produce labels that reflect an objective and more reliable binary distinction based on empirical observations.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-53473">Our analysis aims to answer the following questions:</S>

      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-53481">Negative answers to the first two questions would respectively call into question: i) the intuitive idea that human labels are the most reliable for a supervised approach to binary QE, and ii) the possibility that thresholds on a single metric (e.g. the HTER) can be set to capture the subtle differences separating useful from useless translations.</S>
        <S ID="S-53482">A positive answer to the third question would open to the possibility to create training datasets in a more coherent</S>

        <S ID="S-53489">Our experiments with the WMT- 12 corpus demonstrate that neither following standard indications (e.g. &#8220;if more than 70% of the MT output needs to be edited, a translation from scratch is necessary&#8221;) 3 , nor considering arbitrary HTER thresholds, it is possible to obtain accurate binary classifiers suitable for integration in a CAT environment; &#8226; We propose a replicable automatic (hence non subjective) method to re-annotate an existing dataset in a way that the resulting binary classifier outperforms those trained with human labels.</S>
        <S ID="S-53490">&#8226; We show that, with our method, a smaller amount of training data is sufficient to obtain similar or better performance compared to that of the human-annotated dataset used for comparison.</S>

      <HEADER>2 Binary QE for CAT environments</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-53491">QE has been mainly addressed as a classification or regression task, where a quality score (respectively an integer or a real value) has to be automatically assigned to MT output sentences given their source (<REF ID="R-26" RPTR="29">Specia et al., 2010</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-53492">Casting the problem in this way, the integration of a QE component in a CAT environment makes possible to present translators with estimates of the expected quality of each MT suggestion.</S>
        <S ID="S-53493">Such intuitive solution, however, disregards the fact that even precise QE scores would not alleviate translators from the effort of reading useless MT output (or at least the associated score).</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-53494">A more effective alternative is to use the estimated QE scores to filter out poor MT suggestions, presenting only those worth for post-editing.</S>
        <S ID="S-53495">Binary classification, however, has to confront with the problem of setting reasonable cut-off criteria.</S>
        <S ID="S-53496">The arbitrary thresholds, used in several previous works (<REF ID="R-21" RPTR="22">Quirk, 2004</REF>; <REF ID="R-26" RPTR="30">Specia et al., 2010</REF>; <REF ID="R-27" RPTR="31">Specia et al., 2011</REF>) are in fact hard to justify, and even harder to learn from human-labelled training data.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-53497">3 This was a guideline for the professional translators involved in the annotation of a previous version of the dataset used for the WMT-12 evaluation (see http://www.statmt.org/wmt12/ quality-estimation-task.html).</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-53498">On one side, for instance, there is no evidence that the 70% HTER threshold used in some datasets yields the optimal separation between acceptable and totally useless suggestions.</S>
        <S ID="S-53499">Such arbitrary criterion, based on the raw count of postediting operations, is likely to reflect a partial view on a complex problem, disregarding important aspects such as the distribution of the corrections in the MT output.</S>
        <S ID="S-53500">However, in some cases, having the first 30% of words correctly translated might take less post-editing effort than having 50% of correctly translated terms scattered throughout the whole sentence.</S>
        <S ID="S-53501">In these cases, a 70% HTER threshold would wrongly consider useless translations as positive instances and vice-versa.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-53502">On the other side, when arbitrary thresholds are used as annotation guidelines (<REF ID="R-04" RPTR="5">Callison-Burch et al., 2012</REF>), the moderate agreement between human judges might make manual labels ill-suited to learn accurate models.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-53503">Under the constraints posed by a CAT environment, where only useful suggestions can lead to a significant productivity increase, the ideal model should maximize the number of true positives (useful translations recognized as good) minimizing, at the same time, the number of false positives (useless translations recognized as good).</S>
        <S ID="S-53504">To this aim, the more the training data are partitioned according to objective criteria, the higher the expected reliability of the corresponding cut-off and, in turn, the higher the expected performance of the binary classifier.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-53505">Focusing on these issues, the following sections discuss various methods to obtain training data for binary QE geared to the integration in a CAT environment.</S>
        <S ID="S-53506">Partitions based on human judgements from the WMT-12 dataset will be compared with an automatic method to re-annotate the same corpus.</S>
        <S ID="S-53507">The suitability of the resulting training sets for binary classification will be assessed by measuring the performance of classifiers built from each training set.</S>

      <HEADER>3 Partitioning the WMT-12 dataset</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-53509">Due to the lack of datasets annotated with explicit binary (good, bad) judgements about translation quality, the most intuitive way to obtain training data for our QE classifier is to adapt existing manually-labelled data.</S>
        <S ID="S-53510">The reasonable size of the WMT-12 dataset makes it a good candidate for our purposes.</S>
        <S ID="S-53511">The corpus consists of 2,254 English-Spanish news sentences (1,832 for training, 422 for test) produced by the Moses phrasebased SMT system (<REF ID="R-10" RPTR="9">Koehn et al., 2007</REF>) trained on Europarl (<REF ID="R-11" RPTR="10">Koehn, 2005</REF>) and News Commentaries corpora, 4 along with their source sentences, reference translations and post-edited translations.</S>
        <S ID="S-53512">Training and test instances have been annotated by professional translators with scores (1 to 5) indicating the estimated post-editing effort (percentage of MT output that has to be corrected).</S>
        <S ID="S-53513">According to the proposed scheme, the highest score indicates lowest effort (MT output requires little or no editing), while the lowest score indicates that the MT output needs to be translated from scratch.</S>
        <S ID="S-53514">To cope with systematic biases among the annotators, 5 the judgements were combined in a final score obtained from their weighted average, resulting in a labelled dataset with real numbers in the [1, 5] interval as effort scores.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-53515">In order to obtain suitable data for binary QE, the WMT-12 training set (1,832 instances) has been partitioned in different ways, leaving the test set for evaluation (see Section 5).</S>
        <S ID="S-53516">The goal, for each partition strategy, was to label as bad (the assigned label is -1) only the translations that need complete rewriting, keeping all the other translations as good instances (labelled with +1).</S>
        <S ID="S-53517">Considering the averaged effort scores, the actual human judgements, and the HTER values calculated between the translations and the corresponding postedited version, we experimented with the following three partition criteria.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-53518">Average effort scores (AES).</S>
        <S ID="S-53519">Three partitions have been generated based on the effort scores of 2, 2.5, and 3, labelling the WMT-12 training instances with scores below or equal to each threshold as negative examples (-1), and the instances with scores above the threshold as positive examples (+1).</S>
        <S ID="S-53520">Partitions with thresholds below 2 were also considered, including the most intuitive partition with cut-off set to 1.</S>
        <S ID="S-53521">However, the resulting number of negative instances, if any, was too scarce, and the overall dataset too unbalanced, to make standard supervised learning methods effective The creation of highly unbalanced data is a recurring issue for all the partition meth-</S>

        <S ID="S-53525">ods we applied to the WMT-12 corpus.</S>
        <S ID="S-53526">Together with the low homogeneity of human labels (even for very poor translations the three judges do not agree in assigning the lowest score), in most of the cases the small number of low-quality translations in the dataset makes the negative class considerably smaller than the positive one.</S>
        <S ID="S-53527">This can be observed in Table 1, which provides the total number of positive and negative instances for each partition method.</S>
        <S ID="S-53528">For instance, with our lowest AES threshold (2) the total number of negative instances is 113, while the positive ones are 1,719.</S>
        <S ID="S-53529">Although considering different cut-off criteria aims to make our investigation more complete, it&#8217;s also worth remarking that the higher the threshold, the higher the distance of the resulting experimental setting from our target scenario.</S>
        <S ID="S-53530">While 2, as an effort score threshold, is likely to reflect a reasonable separation between useless and post-editable translations, higher values are in principle more appropriate for &#8220;soft&#8221; separations into worse versus better translations.</S>

      <P>
        <S ID="S-53531">Human scores (HS).</S>
        <S ID="S-53532">Five partitions have been generated using the actual labels assigned by the three annotators to each translation instead of the average effort scores.</S>
        <S ID="S-53533">In particular, we considered the following score combinations (&#8220;X&#8221; stands for any integer between 1 and 5): 1-X-X, 2-2-2, 2- 2-X, 2-3-3, 3-3-3.</S>
        <S ID="S-53534">Also in this case, as shown in Table 1, partitions based on lower scores lead to highly unbalanced datasets of limited usability, while those based on higher scores are increasingly more distant to our application scenario.</S>

        <S ID="S-53538">In this case, being the HTER an error measure, training instances with scores above or equal to the threshold were labelled as negative examples (-1), while instances with lower scores were labelled as positive examples (+1).</S>

        <HEADER>4.1 Approach</HEADER>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-53546">Our approach, which does not involve subjective human judgements, is based on the observation of similarities and dissimilarities between an automatic translation (TGT), its post-edited version (PE) and the corresponding reference translation (RT).</S>
          <S ID="S-53547">Such comparisons provide useful indications about the behaviour of a post-editor when correcting automatic translations and, in turn, about MT output quality.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-53548">Typically, the PE version of a good-quality TGT preserves some characteristics (e.g. lexical, structural) that indicate a moderate correction activity by the post editor.</S>
          <S ID="S-53549">Conversely, in the PE version of a low-quality TGT, such characteristics are more difficult to observe, indicating an intense correction activity.</S>
          <S ID="S-53550">At the two extremes, the PE of a perfect TGT preserves all its characteristics, while the PE of a useless TGT looses most of them.</S>
          <S ID="S-53551">In the first case TGT and PE are iden-</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-53552">tical, and their similarity is the highest possible (i.e. sim(T GT, P E) = 1).</S>
          <S ID="S-53553">In the second case, TGT and PE show a degree of similarity close to that of TGT and a completely rewritten translation featuring different lexical choices and structure.</S>
          <S ID="S-53554">This is where reference translations come into play: considering RT as a good example of rewritten sentence, 7 for low-quality TGT we will have sim(T GT, P E) &#8776; sim(T GT, RT ).</S>
          <S ID="S-53555">In light of these considerations, we hypothesize that the automatic re-annotation of WMT-12 training data can take advantage of a classifier that learns a similarity threshold T such that:</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-53556">&#8226; a PE sentence with sim(T GT, P E) &#8804; T will be considered as a rewritten translation (hence TGT is useless, and the corresponding source-TGT pair a negative example to be labelled as &#8220;-1&#8221;); &#8226; a PE sentence with sim(T GT, P E) &gt; T will be considered as a real post-edition (hence TGT is useful for the post-editor, and the corresponding source-TGT pair a positive example to be labelled as &#8220;+1&#8221;).</S>

          <S ID="S-53557">Based on this hypothesis, to perform our automatic re-annotation procedure we: 1) create a training set Z of positive and negative examples (i.e. [TGT, correct translation] pairs, where correct translation is either a post-editing or a rewritten translation); 2) design a feature set capable to capture different aspects of the similarity between TGT and correct translation; 3) build a binary classifier using Z; 4) use the classifier to label the [TGT, PE] pairs as instances of post-editings or rewritings; 5) assess the quality of the resulting annotation.</S>

          <S ID="S-53579">Differently from the binary QE task, where the possibility to catch common characteristics between two sentences is limited by language barriers, in our re-annotation task all the features are extracted by comparing two monolingual sentences (i.e. TGT and a correct translation, either a PE or a RT).</S>
          <S ID="S-53580">Although the problem of measuring sentence similarity can be addressed in many ways, the solutions should not overlook the specificities of the task.</S>
          <S ID="S-53581">In our case, for instance, the scarce importance of the semantic aspect (TGT, PE and RT typically show a high semantic similarity) makes features used for other tasks (e.g. based on distributional similarity) less effective than shallow features looking at the surface form of the input sentences.</S>

          <S ID="S-53651">12 Two different datasets were split: i) the WMT-12 test (422 source, target, post-edited and reference sentences); ii) the WMT-13 training set for Task 1.3 (800 source, target and post-edited sentences labelled with PET).</S>
          <S ID="S-53652">The first dataset, the most similar to the WMT-12 training set, should better reflect (and reward) the HTER-based partitions proposed in Section 3.</S>
          <S ID="S-53653">The WMT-13 dataset contains sentences translated with a different configuration (data and parameters) of the SMT engine.</S>

          <S ID="S-53675">Although the total number of classifiers tested is 16 (15 resulting from partitions based on human labels, and 1 obtained with our automatic annotation method), most of them are not present in the table since they predict the majority class for all the test points.</S>
          <S ID="S-53676">These are, in general, trained on highly unbalanced training sets where the number of negative samples is really small.</S>
          <S ID="S-53677">However, it is interesting to note that increasing the number of instances in the negative class does not always result in a better classifier.</S>
          <S ID="S-53678">For instance, the classifier built on an HTER separation with threshold at 0.55 performs majority voting even if it is built on a more balanced (but probably more noisy) training set than the classifier obtained with threshold at 0.6.</S>

          <S ID="S-53681">The effectiveness of the automatic annotation is confirmed by the fact that classifiers 3 (based on the average of effort scores - AES) and 3-3-3 (based on the actual human scores - HS), which are trained on more balanced training sets, achieve worse performances than the AA classifier.</S>

          <S ID="S-53689">Comparing the results calculated with the two metrics, we note that weighted accuracy seems to be less sensible to small variations in terms of true and false negatives returned by the classifier, even if the specificity (accuracy on our minority class) is weighted more than sensitivity (accuracy on our majority class).</S>
          <S ID="S-53690">This often results in scores very close (differences &#8804; 10 &#8722;3 ) to the accuracy obtained by majority voting classification (0.3).</S>

          <S ID="S-53692">Our automatic re-annotation approach requires post-edited and reference sentences.</S>
          <S ID="S-53693">Although all the datasets annotated for QE include post-edited sentences, this is not always true for the references.</S>
          <S ID="S-53694">The cost of having both resources is in fact not negligible.</S>
          <S ID="S-53695">For this reason, we investigated the minimal number of training data needed to re-annotate the WMT-12 training set without altering performance on binary classification.</S>
          <S ID="S-53696">To this aim, we selected two of the test sets on which our re-annotation method produces classifiers with high performance results (WMT-13 HTER 0.6 and 0.75), and measured score variations with increasing amounts of data.</S>
          <S ID="S-53697">Nine subsets of the WMT-12 training set corpus were created (with 10%, 20%,..., 100% of the dataset) by sub-sampling sentences from a uniform distribution.</S>
          <S ID="S-53698">The process was iterated 10 times.</S>
          <S ID="S-53699">Then, for each subset, a new re-annotation process was run, the resulting training set was used to build the relative binary QE classifier, which was eventually evaluated on the test set in terms of weighted FPR-FDR.</S>
          <S ID="S-53700">Figures 3 and 4 show the obtained learning curves.</S>
          <S ID="S-53701">Each point is the average result of the 10 runs; the error bars show &#177;1std.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-53702">As can be seen from both curves, performance results with 60% of the training data are already comparable with those obtained using the whole training data.</S>
          <S ID="S-53703">Similar trends have been observed for several learning curves created with different test sets.</S>
          <S ID="S-53704">This shows that, besides avoiding the use of human labelled data, our approach allows to drastically reduce the amount of training instances.</S>
          <S ID="S-53705">Considering the high costs of collecting post-editions, and the fact that reference translations can be taken from parallel corpora, our solution represents a viable way to overcome the lack of training data for binary QE geared towards integration in a CAT environment.</S>

      <HEADER>6 Conclusion</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-53714">We presented a task-oriented analysis of the usefulness of human-labelled data for binary quality estimation.</S>
        <S ID="S-53715">Our target scenario is computerassisted translation, which calls for solutions to present human translators with useful MT suggestions (i.e. easier to correct than to rewrite from scratch).</S>
        <S ID="S-53716">Within this framework, the integration of binary classifiers capable to distinguish &#8220;good&#8221; (useful) from &#8220;bad&#8221; (useless) suggestions would make possible to significantly increase translators&#8217; productivity.</S>
        <S ID="S-53717">Such binary classifiers, however, need labelled training data (possibly of good quality) that are currently not available.</S>
        <S ID="S-53718">An intuitive solution to fill this gap is to take advantage of an existing dataset, adapting its manual annotations to our task.</S>
        <S ID="S-53719">Exploring this solution (the first contribution of this paper) has to face problems related to the subjectivity of human judgements about translation quality, and the resulting variability in the annotation.</S>
        <S ID="S-53720">In particular, our experiments with the WMT-12 dataset show that any adaptation (either based on human judgements or arbitrarily-set HTER thresholds) collides with the problem of setting reasonable partition criteria.</S>
        <S ID="S-53721">Our results suggest that the subtle differences between useful and useless translations make subjective human judgements inadequate to learn effective models.</S>
        <S ID="S-53722">Instead of relying on manually-assigned quality labels, an alternative solution to the problem is to re-annotate an existing dataset.</S>
        <S ID="S-53723">Proposing an automatic way to do that (the second contribution of this paper), we argue that reliable data separations into positive and negative examples can be obtained by measuring the similarities between: i) automatic translations and post-editings, and ii) automatic translations and their references.</S>
        <S ID="S-53724">Our results demonstrate that binary classifiers built from training data produced with our supervised method are less prone to the misclassification of bad suggestions.</S>
        <S ID="S-53725">As in any supervised learning framework, the amount of data needed to obtain good results is of crucial importance.</S>
        <S ID="S-53726">By analysing the demand of our automatic annotation method in terms of training data (the third contribution of this paper), we show that competitive results can be obtained with a fraction of the data needed by methods based on human labels.</S>
        <S ID="S-53727">Our results indicate that a goodquality training set for binary classification can be obtained with 40% less instances of [training, post edited sentence, reference sentence], totally avoiding manually-assigned quality judgements.</S>
        <S ID="S-53728">Our future works will address the improvement of the automatic annotation procedure using supervised methods suitable to learn from unbalanced training sets (e.g. one-class SVM, weighted random forests), and the integration of new features (e.g. GTM, meteor) to refine our classification of a correct sentence into rewritten/post-edited.</S>
        <S ID="S-53729">Then, to boost binary QE results on the resulting corpora, the &#8220;baseline&#8221; features used for experiments in this paper will be extended with new features explored in recent works (<REF ID="R-16" RPTR="15">Mehdad et al., 2012</REF><REF ID="R-17" RPTR="17">Mehdad et al., 2012</REF>a; de Souza et al., 2013; Turchi and Negri, 2013).</S>
