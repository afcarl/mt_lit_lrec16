  <ABSTRACT>
    <A-S ID="S-0">We present a discriminative substring decoder for transliteration.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-1">This decoder extends recent approaches for discriminative character transduction by allowing for a list of known target-language words, an important resource for transliteration.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-2">Our approach improves upon Sherif and Kondrak&#8217;s (2007b) state-of-theart decoder, creating a 28.5% relative improvement in transliteration accuracy on a Japanese katakana-to-English task.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-3">We also conduct a controlled comparison of two feature paradigms for discriminative training: indicators and hybrid generative features.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-4">Surprisingly, the generative hybrid outperforms its purely discriminative counterpart, despite losing access to rich source-context features.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-5">Finally, we show that machine transliterations have a positive impact on machine translation quality, improving human judgments by 0.5 on a 4-point scale.</A-S>

        <S ID="S-6">Transliteration occurs when a word is borrowed into a language with a different character set.</S>
        <S ID="S-7">The word is transcribed into the new character set in such a way as to maintain rough phonetic correspondence; for example, the English word hip-hop becomes &#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533; [hippuhoppu], when transliterated into Japanese.</S>
        <S ID="S-8">A task frequently of interest to the NLP community is backtransliteration, where one seeks the original word, given the borrowed form.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-9">We investigate machine transliteration as a method to handle out-of-vocabulary items in a Japanese-to-English translation system.</S>
        <S ID="S-10">More often than not, this will correspond to backtransliteration.</S>
        <S ID="S-11">Our goal is to prevent the copying or deletion of Japanese words when they are missing from our statistical machine translation (SMT) system&#8217;s translation tables.</S>
        <S ID="S-12">This can have a substantial impact on the quality of SMT output, transforming translations of questionable usefulness, such as:</S>

        <S ID="S-17">Though the techniques we present here are language-independent, we focus this study on the task of Japanese katakana-to-English backtransliteration.</S>
        <S ID="S-18">Katakana is one of the four character types used in the Japanese writing system (along with hiragana, kanji and Roman alphabet), consisting of about 50 syllabic characters.</S>
        <S ID="S-19">It is used primarily to spell foreign loanwords (e.g., &#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533; [chokoreeto] &#8212; chocolate), and names (e.g., &#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533; [kurinton] &#8212; Clinton).</S>
        <S ID="S-20">Therefore, katakana is a strong indicator that a Japanese word can be back-transliterated.</S>
        <S ID="S-21">However, katakana can also be used to spell scientific names of animals and plants (e.g., &#65533;&#65533; [kamo] &#8212; duck), onomatopoeic expressions (e.g., &#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533; [bashabasha] &#8212; splash) and foreign origin words that are not transliterations (e.g., &#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533; [hochikisu] &#8212; stapler).</S>
        <S ID="S-22">These untransliterable cases constitute about 10% of the katakana words in our data.</S>
        <S ID="S-23">We employ a discriminative substring decoder for machine transliteration.</S>
        <S ID="S-24">Following <REF ID="R-28" RPTR="37">Sherif and Kondrak (2007</REF>b), the decoder operates on short source substrings, with each operation producing one or more target characters, as shown in Figure 1.</S>
        <S ID="S-25">However, where previous approaches employ generative modeling, we use structured perceptron training to discriminatively tune parameters according to 0-1 transliteration accuracy.</S>

        <S ID="S-31">Perhaps more significantly, our framework allows us to test two competing styles of features:</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-32">&#8226; sparse indicators, designed to capture the same channel and language modeling data collected by previous generative models, and</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-33">&#8226; components of existing generative models, used as real-valued features in a discriminatively weighted, generative hybrid.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-34">Note that generative hybrids are the norm in SMT, where translation scores are provided by a discriminative combination of generative models (<REF ID="R-23" RPTR="30">Och, 2003</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-35">Substring-based transliteration with a generative hybrid model is very similar to existing solutions for phrasal SMT (<REF ID="R-19" RPTR="26">Koehn et al., 2003</REF>), operating on characters rather than words.</S>
        <S ID="S-36">Unlike out-of-the-box phrasal SMT solutions, our generative hybrid benefits from a target a lexicon.</S>
        <S ID="S-37">As we will show, this is the difference between a weak baseline and a strong competitor.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-38">We demonstrate that despite recent successes in discriminative character transduction using indicator features (Jiampojamarn et al., 2008; <REF ID="R-08" RPTR="10">Dreyer et al., 2008</REF>), our generative hybrid performs surprisingly well, producing our highest transliteration accuracies.</S>
        <S ID="S-39">Researchers frequently compare against a phrasal SMT baseline when evaluating a new transduction technique (<REF ID="R-09" RPTR="13">Freitag and Khadivi, 2007</REF>; <REF ID="R-08" RPTR="11">Dreyer et al., 2008</REF>); however, we are careful to vary only the features in our comparison.</S>
        <S ID="S-40">Confounding variables, such as alignment, decoder and training method, are held constant.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-41">We also include a human evaluation of transliteration-augmented SMT output.</S>
        <S ID="S-42">Though human evaluations are too expensive to allow a comparison between transliteration systems, we are able to show that adding our transliterations to a production-level SMT engine results in a substantial improvement in translation quality.</S>

      <P>
        <S ID="S-81">This work draws inspiration from previous work in transliteration, which we divide into similarity and transduction-based approaches.</S>

        <HEADER>2.1 Similarity-based transliteration</HEADER>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-43">In similarity-based transliteration, a characterbased, cross-lingual similarity metric is calculated (or bootstrapped) from known transliteration pairs.</S>
          <S ID="S-44">Given a source word s, its transliteration is the target word t most similar to s, where t is drawn from some pool of candidates.</S>
          <S ID="S-45">This approach may also be referred to as transliteration discovery.</S>

        <P>
          <S ID="S-53">The work of <REF ID="R-10" RPTR="15">Hermjakob et al. (2008)</REF> is particularly relevant to this paper, as they incorporate a similarity-based transliteration system into an Arabic-to-English SMT engine.</S>
          <S ID="S-54">They employ a hand-crafted cross-lingual similarity metric, and use capitalized n-grams from the Google n-gram corpus as candidates.</S>
          <S ID="S-55">With such a huge candidate list, a cross-lingual indexing scheme is designed for fast candidate look-up.</S>
          <S ID="S-56">Their work also addresses the question of when to transliterate (as opposed to translate), a realistic concern when deploying a transliteration component in SMT.</S>
          <S ID="S-57">This, however, is not of so much concern for katakana, as it is used primarily for loanwords.</S>

        <HEADER>2.2 Transduction-based transliteration</HEADER>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-58">The approach presented in this paper is an instance of transduction-based transliteration, where the source word is transformed into a target word using a sequence of character-level operations.</S>
          <S ID="S-59">The parameters of the transduction process are learned from a collection of transliteration pairs.</S>
          <S ID="S-60">These systems do not require a list of candidates, but many incorporate a target lexicon, favoring target words that occur in the lexicon.</S>
          <S ID="S-61">This approach is also known as transliteration generation.</S>
          <S ID="S-62">The majority of transliteration generation approaches are based on the noisy channel model, where a target t is generated according to P (t|s) &#8733; P (s|t)P (t).</S>
          <S ID="S-63">This approach is typified by finite-state transliteration, where the various stages of the channel model are represented by finite state transducers and automata.</S>
          <S ID="S-64">Early systems employed a complex channel, passing through multiple phonetic representations (<REF ID="R-14" RPTR="21">Knight and Graehl, 1998</REF>; <REF ID="R-02" RPTR="2">Bilac and Tanaka, 2004</REF>), but later versions replaced characters directly (Al- Onaizan and Knight, 2002).</S>
          <S ID="S-65"><REF ID="R-28" RPTR="39">Sherif and Kondrak (2007</REF>b) extend this approach with substring operations in the style of phrasal SMT, and show that doing so improves both accuracy as well as space and time efficiency.</S>
          <S ID="S-66">Note that it is possible to incorporate a target lexicon by making P (t) a word unigram model with a character-based back-off.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-67"><REF ID="R-20" RPTR="27">Li et al. (2004)</REF> present an alternative to the noisy channel with their joint n-gram model, which calculates P (s, t).</S>
          <S ID="S-68">This formulation allows operations to be conditioned on both source and target context.</S>
          <S ID="S-69">However, the inclusion of a candidate list is more difficult in this setting, as P (t) is not given its own model.</S>
          <S ID="S-70"><REF ID="R-16" RPTR="23">Zelenko and Aone (2006)</REF> investigate a purely discriminative, alignment-free approach to transliteration generation.</S>
          <S ID="S-71">The target word is constructed one character at a time, with each new character triggering a suite of features, including indicators for near-by source and target characters, as well a generative target language model.</S>
          <S ID="S-72"><REF ID="R-09" RPTR="14">Freitag and Khadivi (2007)</REF> propose a discriminative, latent edit distance for transliteration.</S>
          <S ID="S-73">In this case, training data need not be aligned in advance, but a latent alignment is produced during decoding.</S>
          <S ID="S-74">Again, the target word is constructed one character at a time, using edit operations that are scored according to source and target context features.</S>
          <S ID="S-75">Both approaches train using a structured perceptron, as we do here.</S>
          <S ID="S-76">However, these models represent a dramatic departure from the existing literature, while ours has clear analogs to the well-known noisy-channel paradigm, which allows for useful comparisons and insights into the advantages of discriminative training.</S>

          <S ID="S-114">We treat these two classes of features as distinct.</S>
          <S ID="S-115">We do so because researchers often use either one approach or the other.</S>
          <S ID="S-116">2 Furthermore, it is not clear how to optimally employ training derivations when combining generative models and sparse indicators: generative models need large amounts of data to collect statistics and relatively little for perceptron training, 3 while sparse indicators require only a large perceptron training set.</S>
          <S ID="S-117">We can further divide feature space according to the information required to calculate each feature.</S>

          <S ID="S-122">Indicator Features Previous approaches to discriminative character transduction tend to employ only sparse indicators (Jiampojamarn et al., 2008; <REF ID="R-08" RPTR="12">Dreyer et al., 2008</REF>).</S>
          <S ID="S-123">This is because sparsity is not a major concern in character-based domains, and sparse indicators are extremely flexible.</S>
          <S ID="S-124">Our emission and transition indicator features follow Jiampojamarn et al. (2008).</S>
          <S ID="S-125">Emission indicators are centered around an operation, such as [&#65533; &#8594; tho].</S>

          <S ID="S-265">For each katakana word left untranslated by the baseline SMT engine, we generated 10-best transliteration candidates and added the katakana- English pairs to the SMT system&#8217;s translation table.</S>
          <S ID="S-266">Perceptron scores were exponentiated, then normalized, to create probabilities, which were given to the SMT system as P (source|target); 9 all other translation features were set to log 1.</S>

          <S ID="S-269">In the absolute evaluation, each SMT output was assigned a score between 1 and 4 (1 = completely useless; 4 = perfect translation); in the relative evaluation, the evaluators were presented with a pair of SMT outputs, with and without the transliteration table, and were asked to judge if they preferred one translation over the other.</S>
          <S ID="S-270">In both evaluation settings, the machine-translated sentences were evaluated by two native speakers of English who have no knowledge of Japanese, with access to a reference translation.</S>

        <P>
          <S ID="S-280">One might expect that any replacement of katakana would improve the perception of MT quality.</S>
          <S ID="S-281">This is not necessarily the case: it can be more confusing to have a drastically incorrect transliteration, such as transliterating &#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533; [appurooda] &#8212; uploader incorrectly as applaud.</S>
          <S ID="S-282">Fortunately, Table 3 shows that we make very few of these sorts of mistakes: the baseline is preferred only rarely.</S>
          <S ID="S-283">Also note that, according the MT 10-best accuracies in Table 2, we would have expected to improve at most 60% of cases, however, the human judgements indicate that our actual rate of improvement is closer to 80%, which demonstrates that even an imperfect transliteration is often useful.</S>

      <HEADER>7 Conclusion</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-287">We have presented a discriminative substring decoder for transliteration.</S>
        <S ID="S-288">Our decoder is based on recent approaches for discriminative character transduction, extended to provide access to a target lexicon.</S>
        <S ID="S-289">We have presented a comparison of indicator and hybrid generative features in a controlled setting, demonstrating that generative models perform surprisingly well when discriminatively weighted.</S>
        <S ID="S-290">We have also shown our discriminative models to be superior to a state-of-theart generative system.</S>
        <S ID="S-291">Finally, we have demonstrated that machine transliteration is immediately useful to end-to-end SMT.</S>
        <S ID="S-292">As mentioned earlier, by focusing on katakana, we bypass the problem of deciding when to transliterate rather than translate; next, we plan to combine our models with a classifier that makes such a decision, allowing us to integrate transliteration into SMT for other language pairs.</S>
