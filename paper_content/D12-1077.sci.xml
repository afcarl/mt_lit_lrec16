      <P>
        <S ID="S-13354">Finding the appropriate word ordering in the target language is one of the most difficult problems for statistical machine translation (SMT), particularly for language pairs with widely divergent syntax.</S>
        <S ID="S-13355">As a result, there is a large amount of previous research that handles the problem of reordering through the use of improved reordering models for phrase-based SMT (Koehn et al., 2005), hierarchical phrase-based translation (Chiang, 2007), syntax-based translation (Yamada and Knight, 2001), or preordering (Xia and McCord, 2004).</S>

        <S ID="S-13359">However, these require a good syntactic parser, which is not available for many languages.</S>
        <S ID="S-13360">In recent work, DeNero and Uszkoreit (2011) suggest that unsupervised grammar induction can be used to create source-sentence parse structure for use in translation as a part of a pre-ordering based translation system.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-13361">In this work, we present a method for inducing a parser for SMT by training a discriminative model to maximize reordering accuracy while treating the parse tree as a latent variable.</S>
        <S ID="S-13362">As a learning framework, we use online large-margin methods to train the model to directly minimize two measures of reordering accuracy.</S>
        <S ID="S-13363">We propose a variety of features, and demonstrate that learning can succeed when no linguistic information (POS tags or parse structure) is available in the source language, but also show that this linguistic information can be simply incorporated when it is available.</S>
        <S ID="S-13364">Experiments find that the proposed model improves both reordering and translation accuracy, leading to average gains of 1.2 BLEU points on English-Japanese and Japanese-English translation without linguistic analysis tools, or up to 1.5 BLEU points when these tools are incorporated.</S>
        <S ID="S-13365">In addition, we show that our model is able to effectively maximize various measures of reordering accuracy, and that the reordering measure that we choose has a direct effect on translation results.</S>

        <S ID="S-13374">the pre-ordering approach to machine translation (Xia and McCord, 2004), which performs translation as a two step process of reordering and translation (Figure 1).</S>
        <S ID="S-13375">Reordering first deterministically transforms F into F &#8242; , which contains the same words as F but is in the order of E. Translation then transforms F &#8242; into E using a method such as phrase-based SMT (Koehn et al., 2003), which can produce accurate translations when only local reordering is required.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-13376">This general framework has been widely studied, with the majority of works relying on a syntactic parser being available in the source language.</S>
        <S ID="S-13377">Reordering rules are defined over this parse either through machine learning techniques (Xia and McCord, 2004; Zhang et al., 2007; Li et al., 2007; Genzel, 2010; Dyer and Resnik, 2010; Khalilov and Sima&#8217;an, 2011) or linguistically motivated manual rules (Collins et al., 2005; Xu et al., 2009; Carpuat et al., 2010; Isozaki et al., 2010b).</S>
        <S ID="S-13378">However, as building a parser for each source language is a resourceintensive undertaking, there has also been some interest in developing reordering rules without the use of a parser (Rottmann and Vogel, 2007; Tromble and Eisner, 2009; DeNero and Uszkoreit, 2011; Visweswariah et al., 2011), and we will follow this thread of research in this paper.</S>
        <S ID="S-13379">In particular, two methods deserve mention for being similar to our approach.</S>
        <S ID="S-13380">First, DeNero and Uszkoreit (2011) learn a reordering model through a three-step process of bilingual grammar induction, training a monolingual parser to reproduce the induced trees, and training a reordering model that selects a reordering based on this parse structure.</S>
        <S ID="S-13381">In contrast, our method trains the model in a single step, treating the parse structure as a latent variable in a discriminative reordering model.</S>
        <S ID="S-13382">In addition Tromble and Eisner (2009) and Visweswariah et al. (2011) present models that use binary classification to decide whether each pair of words should be placed in forward or reverse order.</S>
        <S ID="S-13383">In contrast, our method uses traditional contextfree-grammar models, which allows for simple parsing and flexible parameterization, including features such as those that utilize the existence of a span in the phrase table.</S>
        <S ID="S-13384">Our work is also unique in that we show that it is possible to directly optimize several measures of reordering accuracy, which proves important for achieving good translations.</S>

        <P>
          <S ID="S-13578">Table 2 shows reordering and translation results for orig, 3-step, and lader.</S>
          <S ID="S-13579">It can be seen that the proposed lader outperforms the baselines in both reordering and translation.</S>
          <S ID="S-13580">9 There are a number of reasons why lader outperforms 3-step.</S>
          <S ID="S-13581">First, the pipeline of 3-step suffers from error propogation, with errors in monolingual parsing and reordering resulting in low overall accuracy.</S>
          <S ID="S-13582">10 Second, as Section 5.1 describes, lader breaks ties between oracle parses based on model score, allowing easyto-reproduce model parses to be chosen during training.</S>
          <S ID="S-13583">In fact, lader generally found trees that followed from syntactic constituency, while 3-step more often used terminal nodes</S>

          <S ID="S-13586">9 It should be noted that our results for 3-step are</S>

        <P>
          <S ID="S-13587">significantly worse than those of DeNero and Uszkoreit (2011).</S>
          <S ID="S-13588">Likely reasons include a 20x difference in training data size, the fact that we are using naturally translated text as opposed to text translated specifically to create word alignments, or differences in implementation.</S>
          <S ID="S-13589">10 When using oracle parses, chunk accuracy was up to</S>

        <P>
          <S ID="S-13591">that spanned constituent boundaries (as long as the phrase frequency was high).</S>
          <S ID="S-13592">Finally, as Section 6.2 shows in detail, the ability of lader to maximize reordering accuracy directly allows for improved reordering and translation results.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-13593">It can also be seen that incorporating POS tags or parse trees improves accuracy of both lader and 3-step, particularly for English- Japanese, where syntax has proven useful for pre-ordering, and less so for Japanese-English, where syntactic pre-ordering has been less successful (Sudoh et al., 2011b).</S>
          <S ID="S-13594">We also tested Moses&#8217;s implementation of hierarchical phrase-based SMT (Chiang, 2007), which achieved BLEU scores of 23.21 and 19.30 for English-Japanese and Japanese-English respectively, approximately matching lader in accuracy, but with a significant decrease in decoding speed.</S>
          <S ID="S-13595">Further, when pre-ordering with lader and hierarchical phrase-based SMT were combined, BLEU scores rose to 23.29 and 19.69, indicating that the two techniques can be combined for further accuracy improvements.</S>

          <S ID="S-13597">In general, training successfully maximizes the criterion it is trained on, and L t + L c achieves good results on both measures.</S>
          <S ID="S-13598">We also find that L c and L c +L t achieve the best translation results, which is in concert with Talbot et al. (2011), who find chunk fragmentation is better correlated with translation accuracy than Kendall&#8217;s &#964;.</S>
