        <S ID="S-31571">Within the Interactive-predictive Machine Translation (IMT) framework, a state-of-the-art SMT system is employed in the following way: For a given source sentence, the SMT system fully automatically generates an initial translation.</S>
        <S ID="S-31572">A human translator checks this translation from left to right, correcting the first error.</S>
        <S ID="S-31573">The SMT system then proposes a new extension, taking the correct prefix e i 1 = e 1 .</S>

        <S ID="S-31580">An implementation of the IMT famework was performed in the TransType project (Foster et al., 1997; Langlais et al., 2002) and further improved within the TransType2 project (Esteban et al., 2004; Barrachina et al., 2009).</S>
        <S ID="S-31581">IMT aims at reducing the effort and increasing the productivity of translators, while preserving high-quality translation.</S>
        <S ID="S-31582">In this work, we integrate Confidence Measures (CMs) within the IMT framework to further reduce the user effort.</S>
        <S ID="S-31583">As will be shown, our proposal allows to balance the ratio between user effort and final translation error.</S>

        <P>
          <S ID="S-31553">Confidence estimation have been extensively studied for speech recognition.</S>
          <S ID="S-31554">Only recently have researchers started to investigate CMs for MT (Gandrabur and Foster, 2003; Blatz et al., 2004; Ueffing and Ney, 2007).</S>

        <P>
          <S ID="S-31555">Different TransType-style MT systems use confidence information to improve translation prediction accuracy (Gandrabur and Foster, 2003; Ueffing and Ney, 2005).</S>
          <S ID="S-31556">In this work, we propose a focus shift in which CMs are used to modify the interaction between the user and the system instead of modify the IMT translation predictions.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-31557">To compute CMs we have to select suitable confidence features and define a binary classifier.</S>

      <HEADER>2 IMT with Sentence CMs</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-31605">In the conventional IMT scenario a human translator and a SMT system collaborate in order to obtain the translation the user has in mind.</S>
        <S ID="S-31606">Once the user has interactively translated the source sentences, the output translations are error-free.</S>
        <S ID="S-31607">We propose an alternative scenario where not all the source sentences are interactively translated by the user.</S>
        <S ID="S-31608">Specifically, only those source sentences</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-31609">whose initial fully automatic translation are incorrect, according to some quality criterion, are interactively translated.</S>
        <S ID="S-31610">We propose to use CMs as the quality criterion to classify those initial translations.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-31611">Our approach implies a modification of the user-machine interaction protocol.</S>
        <S ID="S-31612">For a given source sentence, the SMT system generates an initial translation.</S>
        <S ID="S-31613">Then, if the CM classifies this translation as correct, we output it as our final translation.</S>
        <S ID="S-31614">On the contrary, if the initial translation is classified as incorrect, we perform a conventional IMT procedure, validating correct prefixes and generating new suffixes, until the sentence that the user has in mind is reached.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-31615">In our scenario, we allow the final translations to be different from the ones the user has in mind.</S>
        <S ID="S-31616">This implies that the output may contain errors.</S>
        <S ID="S-31617">If a small loss in translation can be tolerated for the sake of efficiency, user effort can be saved by interactively translating only those sentences that the CMs classify as incorrect.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-31618">It is worth of notice that our proposal can be seen as a generalisation of the conventional IMT approach.</S>
        <S ID="S-31619">Varying the value of the CM classification threshold, we can range from a fully automatic SMT system where all sentences are classified as correct to a conventional IMT system where all sentences are classified as incorrect.</S>

        <HEADER>2.1 Selecting a CM for IMT</HEADER>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-31584">We compute sentence CMs by combining the scores given by a word CM based on the IBM model 1 (Brown et al., 1993), similar to the one described in (Blatz et al., 2004).</S>
          <S ID="S-31585">We modified this word CM by replacing the average by the maximal lexicon probability, because the average is dominated by this maximum (Ueffing and Ney, 2005).</S>
          <S ID="S-31586">We choose this word CM because it can be calculated very fast during search, which is crucial given the time constraints of the IMT systems.</S>
          <S ID="S-31587">Moreover, its performance is similar to that of other word CMs as results presented in (Blatz et al., 2003; Blatz et al., 2004) show.</S>

          <S ID="S-31625">WSR is computed as the ratio between the number of word-strokes a user would need to achieve the translation she has in mind and the total number of words in the sentence.</S>
          <S ID="S-31626">In this context, a word-stroke is interpreted as a single action, in which the user types a complete word, and is assumed to have constant cost.</S>
          <S ID="S-31627">Additionally, and because our proposal allows differences between its output and the reference translation, we will also present translation quality results in terms of BiLingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) (Papineni et al., 2002).</S>

          <S ID="S-31629">Our experiments were carried out on the EU corpora (Barrachina et al., 2009).</S>
          <S ID="S-31630">The EU corpora were extracted from the Bulletin of the European Union.</S>
          <S ID="S-31631">The EU corpora is composed of sentences given in three different language pairs.</S>

          <S ID="S-31636">This was done by means of the Thot toolkit (Ortiz et al., 2005), which is a complete system for building phrasebased SMT models.</S>
          <S ID="S-31637">This toolkit involves the estimation, from the training set, of different statistical models, which are in turn combined in a loglinear fashion by adjusting a weight for each of them by means of the MERT (Och, 2003) proce-</S>

          <S ID="S-31641">The IMT system which we have implemented relies on the use of word graphs (Ueffing et al., 2002) to efficiently compute the suffix for a given prefix.</S>
          <S ID="S-31642">A word graph has to be generated for each sentence to be interactively translated.</S>
          <S ID="S-31643">For this purpose, we used a multi-stack phrase-based decoder which will be distributed in the near future together with the Thot toolkit.</S>
          <S ID="S-31644">We discarded to use the state-of-the-art Moses toolkit (Koehn et al., 2007) because preliminary experiments performed with it revealed that the decoder by Ortiz- Mart&#237;nez et al. (2005) performs better in terms of WSR when used to generate word graphs for their use in IMT (Sanchis-Trilles et al., 2008).</S>
          <S ID="S-31645">Moreover, the performance difference in regular SMT is negligible.</S>
          <S ID="S-31646">The decoder was set to only consider monotonic translation, since in real IMT scenarios considering non-monotonic translation leads to excessive response time for the user.</S>
          <S ID="S-31647">Finally, the obtained word graphs were used within the IMT procedure to produce the reference translations in the test set, measuring WSR and BLEU.</S>
