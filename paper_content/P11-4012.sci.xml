      <P>
        <S ID="S-33942">The research in the field of machine translation (MT) aims to develop computer systems which are able to translate text or speech without human intervention.</S>
        <S ID="S-33943">However, current translation technology has not been able to deliver full automated highquality translations.</S>
        <S ID="S-33944">Typical solutions to improve the quality of the translations supplied by an MT system require manual post-editing.</S>
        <S ID="S-33945">This serial process prevents the MT system from integrating the knowledge of the human translator.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-33946">An alternative way to take advantage of the existing MT technologies is to use them in collaboration with human translators within a computer-assisted translation (CAT) or interactive framework (<REF ID="R-04" RPTR="7">Isabelle and Church, 1997</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-33947">Interactivity in CAT has been explored for a long time.</S>
        <S ID="S-33948">Systems have been designed to interact with linguists to solve ambiguities or update user dictionaries.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-33949">An important contribution to CAT technology was pioneered by the TransType project (<REF ID="R-02" RPTR="5">Foster et al., 1997</REF>; <REF ID="R-07" RPTR="10">Langlais et al., 2002</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-33950">The idea proposed in that work was to embed data driven MT techniques within the interactive translation environment.</S>
        <S ID="S-33951">Following the TransType ideas, <REF ID="R-00" RPTR="0">Barrachina et al. (2009)</REF> proposed the so-called IMT framework, in which fully-fledged statistical MT (SMT) systems are used to produce full target sentences hypotheses, or portions thereof, which can be accepted or amended by a human translator.</S>
        <S ID="S-33952">Each corrected text segment is then used by the MT system as additional information to achieve improved suggestions.</S>
        <S ID="S-33953">Figure 1 shows an example of a typical IMT session.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-33954">The vast majority of the existing work on IMT makes use of the well-known batch learning paradigm.</S>
        <S ID="S-33955">In the batch learning paradigm, the training of the IMT system and the interactive translation process are carried out in separate stages.</S>
        <S ID="S-33956">This paradigm is not able to take advantage of the new knowledge produced by the user of the IMT system.</S>
        <S ID="S-33957">In this paper, we present an application of the online learning paradigm to the IMT framework.</S>
        <S ID="S-33958">In the online learning paradigm, the training and prediction stages are no longer separated.</S>
        <S ID="S-33959">This feature is particularly useful in IMT since it allows to take into account the user feedback.</S>
        <S ID="S-33960">Specifically, our proposed IMT system can be extended with the new training samples that are generated each time the user validates the translation of a given source sentence.</S>
        <S ID="S-33961">The online learning techniques implemented in our IMT system incrementally update the statistical models involved in the translation process.</S>

        <S ID="S-33962">There are some works on IMT in the literature that try to take advantage of user feedback.</S>
        <S ID="S-33963">One example is the work by <REF ID="R-09" RPTR="12">Nepveu et al. (2004)</REF>, where dynamic adaptation of an IMT system via cache-based model extensions to language and translation models is proposed.</S>
        <S ID="S-33964">One major drawback of such proposal is its inability to learn new words.</S>

        <S ID="S-33972">In that work, the authors present a very constrained version of online learning, which is not able to extend the translation models due to the high time cost of the learning process.</S>

        <S ID="S-33973">We have adopted the online learning techniques proposed in (Ortiz-Mart&#237;nez et al., 2010) to implement our IMT system.</S>

          <S ID="S-34023">Specifically, our proposed IMT system implements the set of training algorithms that are required to incrementally update each component of the loglinear model.</S>

      <P>
        <S ID="S-34090">We have described an IMT system with online learning which is able to learn from user feedback in real time.</S>
        <S ID="S-34091">As far as we know, to our knowledge, this feature have never been provided by previously presented IMT prototypes.</S>
        <S ID="S-34092">The proposed IMT tool is publicly available through the Web (http://cat.iti.upv.es/ imt/).</S>
        <S ID="S-34093">Currently, the system can be used to interactively translate the well-known Europarl corpus.</S>
        <S ID="S-34094">We have also carried out experiments with simulated users.</S>
        <S ID="S-34095">According to such experiments, our IMT system is able to outperform the results obtained by conventional IMT systems implementing batch learning.</S>
        <S ID="S-34096">Future work includes researching further on the benefits provided by our online learning techniques with experiments involving real users.</S>
