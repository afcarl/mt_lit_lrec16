        <S ID="S-24085">The translation procedure of a classical phrasebased translation model (<REF ID="R-08" RPTR="9">Koehn et al., 2003</REF>) first divides the input sentence into a sequence of phrases, translates each phrase, explores reorderings of these translations, and then scores the resulting candidates with a linear combination of models.</S>
        <S ID="S-24086">Conventional models include phrase-based channel models that effectively model each phrase as a large unigram, reordering models, and target language models.</S>
        <S ID="S-24087">Of these models, only the target language model</S>

        <S ID="S-24090">(and, to some weak extent, the lexicalized reordering model) captures some lexical dependencies that span phrase boundaries, though it is not able to model information from the source side.</S>
        <S ID="S-24091">Larger phrases capture more contextual dependencies within a phrase, but individual phrases are still translated almost independently.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-24092">To address this limitation, several researchers have proposed bilingual n-gram Markov models (Marino et al., 2006) to capture contextual dependencies between phrase pairs.</S>
        <S ID="S-24093">Much of their work is limited by the requirement &#8220;that the source and target side of a tuple of words are synchronized, i.e. that they occur in the same order in their respective languages&#8221; (<REF ID="R-01" RPTR="3">Crego and Yvon, 2010</REF>).</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-24094">For language pairs with significant typological divergences, such as Chinese-English, it is quite difficult to extract a synchronized sequence of units; in the limit, the smallest synchronized unit may be the whole sentence.</S>
        <S ID="S-24095">Other approaches explore incorporation into syntax-based MT systems or replacing the phrasal translation system altogether.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-24096">We investigate the addition of MTUs to a phrasal translation system to improve modeling of context and to provide more robust estimation of long phrases.</S>
        <S ID="S-24097">However, in a phrase-based system there is no single synchronized traversal order; instead, we may consider the translation units in many possible orders: left-to-right or right-to-left according to either the source or the target are natural choices.</S>
        <S ID="S-24098">Alternatively we consider translating a particularly unambiguous unit in the middle of the sentence and building outwards from there.</S>
        <S ID="S-24099">We investigate both consistent and dynamic decomposition orders in several language pairs, looking at distinct orders in isolation and combination.</S>

        <S ID="S-24101"><REF ID="R-01" RPTR="2">Crego and Yvon (2010)</REF> further explored factorized n-gram approaches, though both models considered rather large n-grams; this paper focuses on small units with asynchronous orders in source and target.</S>
        <S ID="S-24102">Durrani et al. (2011) developed a joint model that captures translation of contiguous and gapped units as well as reordering.</S>

        <S ID="S-24105">Likewise in target language syntax systems, one can consider Markov models over minimal rules, where the translation probability of each rule is adjusted to include context information from parent rules (Vaswani et al., 2011).</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-24106">Most prior work tends to replace the existing probabilities rather than augmenting them.</S>
        <S ID="S-24107">We believe that Markov rules provide an additional signal but are not a replacement.</S>
        <S ID="S-24108">Their distributions should be more informative than the so-called &#8220;lexical weighting&#8221; models, and less sparse than relative frequency estimates, though potentially not as effective for truly non-compositional units.</S>
        <S ID="S-24109">Therefore, we explore the inclusion of all such information.</S>
        <S ID="S-24110">Also, unlike prior work, we explore combinations of multiple decomposition orders, as well as dynamic decompositions.</S>

        <HEADER>3.2 MTU enumeration orders</HEADER>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-24146">When defining a joint probability distribution over MTUs of an aligned sentence pair, it is necessary to define a decomposition, or generation order for the sentence pair.</S>
          <S ID="S-24147">For a single sequence in language modeling or synchronized sequences in channel modeling, the default enumeration order has been left-to-right.</S>
          <S ID="S-24148">Different decomposition orders have been used in part-of-speech tagging and named entity recognition (<REF ID="R-19" RPTR="21">Tsuruoka and Tsujii, 2005</REF>).</S>
          <S ID="S-24149">Intuitively, information from the left or right could be more useful for particular disambiguation choices.</S>
          <S ID="S-24150">Our research on different decomposition orders was motivated by this work.</S>
          <S ID="S-24151">When applying such ideas to machine translation, there are additional challenges and opportunities.</S>
          <S ID="S-24152">The task exhibits much more ambiguity &#8211; the number of possible MTUs is in the millions.</S>
          <S ID="S-24153">An opportunity arises from the reordering phenomenon in machine translation: while in POS tagging the natural decomposition orders to study are only left-to-right and right-to-left, in machine translation we can further distinguish source and target sentence orders.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-24154">We first define the source left-to-right and the target left-to-right orders of the aligned sets of MTUs.</S>
          <S ID="S-24155">The definition is straightforward when there are no inserted or deleted word.</S>
          <S ID="S-24156">To place the nulls corresponding to such word we use the following definition: the source position of the null for a target inserted word is just after the position of the last source word aligned to the closest preceding nonnull aligned target word.</S>
          <S ID="S-24157">The target position for a null corresponding to a source deleted MTU is defined analogously.</S>
          <S ID="S-24158">In Figure 1 we define the position of M4 to be right after M3 (because &#8220;the&#8221; is after &#8220;held&#8221; in left-to-right order on the target side).</S>
          <S ID="S-24159">The complete MTU sequence in source left-toright order is M1-M2-M3-M4-M5.</S>
          <S ID="S-24160">The sequence in target left-to-right order is M3-M4-M5-M1-M2.</S>

          <S ID="S-24162">Once a sentence pair is represented as a sequence of MTUs, we can define the probability of the sentence pair using a conventional n-gram Markov model (MM) over MTUs.</S>
          <S ID="S-24163">For example, the 3-gram MM probability of the sentence pair in Figure 1 under the source left-to-right order is as follows: P(M1)&#183;P(M2|M1)&#183;P(M3|M1, M2)&#183;P(M4|M2, M3)&#183; P(M5|M3, M4).</S>

          <S ID="S-24166">Although the independence assumptions of left-to-right and right-to-left are the same, the resulting models may be different due to smoothing.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-24167">In addition to studying these four basic decomposition orders, we report performance of two cyclic orders: cyclic in source or target sentence order.</S>
          <S ID="S-24168">These models are inspired by the cyclic dependency network model proposed for POS tagging (<REF ID="R-18" RPTR="18">Toutanova et al., 2003</REF>) and also used as a baseline in previous work on dynamic decomposition orders (<REF ID="R-19" RPTR="22">Tsuruoka and Tsujii, 2005</REF>).</S>

        <P>
          <S ID="S-24361">We first report detailed experiments on Chinese- English, and then verify our main conclusions on the other language pairs.</S>
          <S ID="S-24362">Table 4 looks at the impact of individual 3-gram and 5-gram MTU Markov models and their combination.</S>
          <S ID="S-24363">Amongst the decomposition orders tested (L2RT, R2LT, L2RS, and R2LS), each of the individual MTU MMs was able to achieve significant improvement over the baseline, around 1 BLEU point.</S>
          <S ID="S-24364">6 The results achieved by the individual models differ, and the combination of four directions is better than the best individual direction, but the difference is not statistically significant.</S>
          <S ID="S-24365">We ran an additional experiment to test whether MTU MMs make effective use of context across phrase boundaries, or whether they simply provide better smoothed estimates of phrasal translation probabilities.</S>
          <S ID="S-24366">The last row of the table reports the results achieved by a combination of MTU MMs that do not use context across the phrasal boundaries.</S>
          <S ID="S-24367">Since an MTU MM limited to look only inside phrases can provide improved smoothing compared to whole phrase relative frequency counts, it is conceivable it could provide a large improvement.</S>
          <S ID="S-24368">However, there is no improvement in practice for this language pair; the additional improvements from MTU MMs stem from modeling cross-phrase context.</S>

          <S ID="S-24375">For English-Bulgarian all individual 3-gram Markov models achieve significant improvements of close to one point; their combination is better than the best individual model (but not significantly).</S>
          <S ID="S-24376">The individual 5-gram models and their combination bring much larger improvement, for a total increase of 2.82 points over the baseline.</S>
          <S ID="S-24377">We believe the 5- gram models were more effective in this setting because the larger training set allowed for successful training of models of larger capacity.</S>
          <S ID="S-24378">Also the increased context size helps to resolve ambiguity in the forms of morphologically-rich Bulgarian words.</S>
          <S ID="S-24379">For German-English we see a similar pattern, with the combination of models outperforming the individual ones, and the 5-gram models being better than the 3-gram.</S>
          <S ID="S-24380">Here the individual 3-gram models are better than the baseline at significance level 0.02 and their combination is better than the baseline at our earlier defined threshold of 0.01.</S>
          <S ID="S-24381">The withinphrase MTU MMs (results shown in the last two rows) improve upon the baseline slightly, but here again the improvements mostly stem from the use of context across phrase boundaries.</S>
          <S ID="S-24382">Our final results on German-English are better than the best result of 27.30 from the shared task (<REF ID="R-07" RPTR="8">Koehn and Monz, 2006</REF>).</S>

          <S ID="S-24384">(<REF ID="R-00" RPTR="1">Clark et al., 2011</REF>) proposed a stratified approximate randomization statistical significance test, which controls for optimizer instability.</S>
          <S ID="S-24385">Using this test, for the English-Bulgarian system, we confirmed that the combination of four 3-gram MMs and the combination of 5-gram MMs is better than the baseline (p = .0001 for both, using five runs of parameter tuning).</S>

      <HEADER>7 Conclusions</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-24389">We introduced models of Minimal Translation Units for phrasal systems, and showed that they make a substantial and statistically significant improvement on three distinct language-pairs.</S>
        <S ID="S-24390">Additionally we studied the importance of decomposition order when defining the probability of MTU sequences.</S>
        <S ID="S-24391">In a simplified lexical selection task, we saw that there were large differences in performance among the different decompositions, with the best decompositions differing by language.</S>
        <S ID="S-24392">We investigated multiple methods to combine decompositions and found that a simple product approach was most effective.</S>
        <S ID="S-24393">Results in the lexical selection task were consistent with those obtained in a full MT system, although the differences among decompositions were smaller.</S>
        <S ID="S-24394">In future work, perhaps we would see larger gains by including additional decomposition orders (e.g., top-down in a dependency tree), and taking this idea deeper into the machine translation model, down to the word-alignment and language-modeling levels.</S>
        <S ID="S-24395">We were surprised to find n-best reranking so effective.</S>
        <S ID="S-24396">We are incorporating the models into first pass decoding, in hopes of even greater gains.</S>
