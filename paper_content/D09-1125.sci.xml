      <HEADER>1 Introduction</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-7682">System combination for machine translation (MT) has emerged as a powerful method of combining the strengths of multiple MT systems and achieving results which surpass those of each individual system (e.g. Bangalore, et.</S>
        <S ID="S-7683">al., 2001, Matusov, et.</S>
        <S ID="S-7684">al., 2006, Rosti, et.</S>
        <S ID="S-7685">al., 2007a).</S>
        <S ID="S-7686">Most state-of-the-art system combination methods are based on constructing a confusion network (CN) from several input translation hypotheses, and choosing the best output from the CN based on several scoring functions (e.g. Rosti et.</S>
        <S ID="S-7687">al., 2007a, He et.</S>
        <S ID="S-7688">al., 2008, Matusov et al. 2008).</S>
        <S ID="S-7689">Confusion networks allow word-level system combination, which was shown to outperform sentence re-ranking methods and phrase-level combination (Rosti, et.</S>
        <S ID="S-7690">al. 2007a).</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-7691">We will review confusion-network-based system combination with the help of the examples in Figures 1 and 2.</S>
        <S ID="S-7692">Figure 1 shows translation hypotheses from three Chinese-to- English MT systems.</S>
        <S ID="S-7693">The general idea is to combine hypotheses in a representation such as the ones in Figure 2, where for each word position there is a set of possible words, shown in columns.</S>
        <S ID="S-7694">1 The final output is determined by choosing one word from each column, which can be a real word or the empty word &#949;.</S>
        <S ID="S-7695">For example, the CN in Figure 2a) can generate eight distinct sequences of words, including e.g. &#8220;she bought the Jeep&#8221; and &#8220;she bought the SUV Jeep&#8221;.</S>
        <S ID="S-7696">The choice is performed to maximize a scoring function using a set of features and a log-linear model (Matusov, et.</S>
        <S ID="S-7697">al 2006, Rosti, et al. 2007a).</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-7698">We can view a confusion network as an ordered sequence of columns (correspondence sets).</S>
        <S ID="S-7699">Each word from each input hypothesis belongs to exactly one correspondence set.</S>
        <S ID="S-7700">Each correspondence set contains at most one word from each input hypothesis and contributes exactly one of its words (including the possible &#949;) to the final output.</S>
        <S ID="S-7701">Final words are output in the order of correspondence sets.</S>
        <S ID="S-7702">In order to construct such a representation, we need to solve the following two sub-problems: arrange words from all input hypotheses into correspondence sets (alignment problem) and order correspondence sets (ordering problem).</S>
        <S ID="S-7703">After constructing the confusion network we need to solve a third sub-problem: decide which words to output from each correspondence set (lexical choice problem).</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-7704">In current state-of-the-art approaches, the construction of the confusion network is performed as follows: first, a backbone hypothesis is selected.</S>
        <S ID="S-7705">The backbone hypothesis determines the order of words in the final system output, and guides word-level alignments for construction of columns of possible words at each position.</S>
        <S ID="S-7706">Let us assume that for our example in Figure 1, the second hypothesis is selected as a backbone.</S>
        <S ID="S-7707">All other hypotheses are aligned to the backbone such that these alignments are one-to-one; empty words are inserted where necessary to make one-to-one</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-7708">1 This representation is alternative to directed acyclic</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-7709">graph representations of confusion networks.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-7710">alignment possible.</S>
        <S ID="S-7711">Words in all hypotheses are sorted by the position of the backbone word they align to and the confusion network is determined.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-7712">It is clear that the quality of selection of the backbone and alignments has a large impact on the performance, because the word order is determined by the backbone, and the set of possible words at each position is determined by alignment.</S>
        <S ID="S-7713">Since the space of possible alignments is extremely large, approximate and heuristic techniques have been employed to derive them.</S>
        <S ID="S-7714">In pair-wise alignment, each hypothesis is aligned to the backbone in turn, with separate processing to combine the multiple alignments.</S>
        <S ID="S-7715">Several models have been used for pair-wise alignment, starting with TER and proceeding with more sophisticated techniques such as HMM models, ITG, and IHMM (Rosti et.</S>
        <S ID="S-7716">al 2007a, Matusov et al 2008, Krakos et al. 2008, <REF ID="R-01" RPTR="0">He et al. 2008</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-7717">A major problem with such methods is that each hypothesis is aligned to the backbone independently, leading to suboptimal behavior.</S>
        <S ID="S-7718">For example, suppose that we use a state-of-the-art word alignment model for pairs of hypotheses, such as the IHMM.</S>
        <S ID="S-7719">Figure 1 shows likely alignment links between every pair of hypotheses.</S>
        <S ID="S-7720">If Hypothesis 1 is aligned to Hypothesis 2 (the backbone), Jeep is likely to align to SUV because they express similar Chinese content.</S>
        <S ID="S-7721">Hypothesis 3 is separately aligned to the backbone and since the alignment is constrained to be one-to-one, SUV is aligned to SUV and Jeep to an empty word which is inserted after SUV.</S>
        <S ID="S-7722">The network in Figure 2a) is the result of this process.</S>
        <S ID="S-7723">An undesirable property of this CN is that the two instances of Jeep are placed in separate columns and cannot vote to reinforce each other.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-7724">Incremental alignment methods have been proposed to relax the independence assumption of pair-wise alignment (<REF ID="R-11" RPTR="9">Rosti et al. 2008</REF>, Li et al. 2009).</S>
        <S ID="S-7725">Such methods align hypotheses to a partially constructed CN in some order.</S>
        <S ID="S-7726">For example, if in such method, Hypothesis 3 is first aligned to the backbone, followed by Hypothesis 1, we are likely to arrive at the CN in Figure 2b) in which the two instances of Jeep are aligned.</S>
        <S ID="S-7727">However, if Hypothesis 1 is aligned to the backbone first, we would still get the CN in Figure 2a).</S>
        <S ID="S-7728">Notice that the desirable output &#8220;She bought the Jeep SUV&#8221; cannot be generated from either of the confusion networks because a rereordering of columns would be required.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-7729">A common characteristic of CN-based approaches is that the order of words (backbone) and the alignment of words (correspondence sets) are decided as greedy steps independently of the lexical choice for the final output.</S>
        <S ID="S-7730">The backbone and alignment are optimized according to auxiliary scoring functions and heuristics which may or may not be optimal with respect to producing CNs leading to good translations.</S>
        <S ID="S-7731">In some recent approaches, these assumptions are relaxed to allow each input hypothesis as a backbone.</S>
        <S ID="S-7732">Each backbone produces a separate CN and the decision of which CN to choose is taken at a later decoding stage, but this still restricts the possible orders and alignments greatly (<REF ID="R-11" RPTR="10">Rosti et al. 2008</REF>, Matusov et al. 2008).</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-7733">In this paper, we present a joint optimization method for system combination.</S>
        <S ID="S-7734">In this method, the alignment, ordering and lexical selection subproblems are solved jointly in a single decoding framework based on a log-linear model.</S>

      <HEADER>2 Related Work</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-7757">There has been a large body of work on MT system combination.</S>
        <S ID="S-7758">Among confusion-networkbased algorithms, most relevant to our work are state-of-the-art methods for constructing word alignments (correspondence sets) and methods for improving the selection of a backbone hypothesis.</S>
        <S ID="S-7759">We have already reviewed such work in the introduction and will note relation to</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-7760">specific models throughout the paper as we discuss specifics of our scoring functions.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-7761">In confusion network algorithms which use pair-wise (or incremental) word-level alignment algorithms for correspondence set construction, problems of converting many-to-many alignments and handling multiple insertions and deletions need to be addressed.</S>
        <S ID="S-7762">Prior work has used a number of heuristics to deal with these problems (Matusov, et.</S>
        <S ID="S-7763">al., 2006, He et al 08).</S>
        <S ID="S-7764">Some work has made such decisions in a more principled fashion by computing model-based scores (Matusov et al. 2008), but still specialpurpose algorithms and heuristics are needed and a single alignment is fixed.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-7765">In our approach, no heuristics are used to convert alignments and no concept of a backbone is used.</S>
        <S ID="S-7766">Instead, the globally highest scoring combination of alignment, order, and lexical choice is selected (subject to search error).</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-7767">Other than confusion-network-based algorithms, work most closely related to ours is the method of MT system combination proposed in (<REF ID="R-02" RPTR="3">Jayaraman and Lavie 2005</REF>), which we will refer to as J&amp;L.</S>
        <S ID="S-7768">Like our method, this approach performs word-level system combination and is not limited to following the word order of a single backbone hypothesis; it also allows more flexibility in the selection of correspondence sets during decoding, compared to a confusionnetwork-based approach.</S>
        <S ID="S-7769">Even though their algorithm and ours are broadly similar, there are several important differences.</S>
        <S ID="S-7770">Firstly, the J&amp;L approach is based on pairwise alignments between words in different hypotheses, which are hard and do not have associated probabilities.</S>
        <S ID="S-7771">Every word in every hypothesis is aligned to at most one word from each of the remaining hypotheses.</S>
        <S ID="S-7772">Thus there is no uncertainty about which words should belong to the correspondence set of an aligned word w, once that word is selected to extend a partial hypothesis during search.</S>
        <S ID="S-7773">If words do not have corresponding matching words in some hypotheses, heuristic matching to currently unused words is attempted.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-7774">In contrast, our algorithm is based on the definition of a joint scoring model, which takes into account alignment uncertainty and combines information from word-level alignment models, ordering and lexical selection models, to address the three sub-problems of word-level system combination.</S>
        <S ID="S-7775">In addition to the language model and word-voting features used by the J&amp;L model, we incorporate features which measure alignment confidence via word-level alignment models and features which evaluate re-ordering via distortion models with respect to original hypotheses.</S>
        <S ID="S-7776">While the J&amp;L search algorithm incorporates a number of special-purpose heuristics to address phenomena of unused words lagging behind the last used words, the goal in our work is to minimize heuristics and perform search to jointly optimize the assignment of hidden variables (ordered correspondence sets) and observed output variables (words in final translations).</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-7777">Finally, the J&amp;L method has not been evaluated in comparison to confusion-networkbased methods to study the impact of performing joint decoding for the three sub-problems.</S>

      <HEADER>3 Notation</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-7778">Before elaborating the models and decoding algorithms, we first clarify the notation that will be used in the paper.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-7779">We denote by H =  1 , &#8230; ,  N the set of hypotheses from multiple MT systems, where  i is the hypothesis from the i-th system and  i is a word sequence w i,1 , &#8230; , w i,L(i) with length L(i).</S>
        <S ID="S-7780">For simplicity, we assume that each system contributes only its 1-best hypothesis for combination.</S>
        <S ID="S-7781">Accordingly, the i-th hypothesis  i will be associated with a weight W(i) which is the weight of the i-th system.</S>
        <S ID="S-7782">In the scenario that N-best lists are available from individual systems for combination, the weight of each hypothesis can be computed based on its rank in the N-best list (Rosti et.</S>
        <S ID="S-7783">al. 2007a).</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-7784">Like in CN-based system combination, we construct a set of ordered correspondence sets (CS) from input hypotheses, and select one word from each CS to form the final output.</S>
        <S ID="S-7785">A CS is defined as a set of (possibly empty) words, one from each hypothesis, that implicitly align to each other and that contributes exactly one of its words to the final output.</S>
        <S ID="S-7786">A valid complete set of CS includes each non-empty word from each hypothesis in exactly one CS.</S>
        <S ID="S-7787">As opposed to CNbased algorithms, our ordered correspondence sets are constructed during a joint decoding process which performs lexical selection at the same time.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-7788">To facilitate the presentation of our features, we define notation for ordered CS.</S>
        <S ID="S-7789">A sequence of correspondence sets is denoted by C= CS 1 , &#8230; , CS m .</S>
        <S ID="S-7790">Each correspondence set is specified by listing the positions of each of the words in the CS in their respective input</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-7791">hypotheses.</S>
        <S ID="S-7792">Each input hypothesis is assumed to have one special empty word &#949; at position 0.</S>
        <S ID="S-7793">A CS is denoted by CS l 1 , &#8230; , l N = w 1,l1 , &#8230; , w N,lN , where w i,li is the l i -th word in the i-th hypothesis and the word position vector v = l 1 , &#8230; , l N T specifies the position of each word in its original hypothesis.</S>
        <S ID="S-7794">Correspondingly, word w i,li has the same weight W(i) as its original hypothesis i .</S>
        <S ID="S-7795">As an example, the last two correspondence sets specified by the CN in Figure 2a) would be specified as CS 4 = CS 4,4,4 = {Jeep, SUV, SUV} and CS 5 = CS 0,0,5 = {&#949;, &#949;, Jeep}.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-7796">As opposed to the CS defined in a conventional CN, words that have the same surface form but come from different hypotheses are not collapsed to be one single candidate since they have different original word positions.</S>
        <S ID="S-7797">We need to trace each of them separately during the decoding process.</S>

        <P>
          <S ID="S-7962">In order to estimate the future cost of an unfinished path, we treat the unvisited words of one input hypothesis as a backbone, and apply a greedy search for alignment based on it; i.e., for each word of this backbone, the most likely words (based on the alignment link scores) from other hypotheses, one word from each hypothesis, are collected to form a CS.</S>
          <S ID="S-7963">These CS are ordered according to the word order of the backbone and form a CN.</S>
          <S ID="S-7964">Then, a light decoding process with a search beam of size one is applied to decode this CN and find the approximate future path, with future feature scores computed during the decoding process.</S>

          <S ID="S-7968">At a certain point a path will reach the end, i.e., no more states can be generated from it according to the state expansion requirement.</S>
          <S ID="S-7969">Then it is marked as a finished path.</S>
          <S ID="S-7970">However, sometimes the state may contain a few input words that have not been visited.</S>
          <S ID="S-7971">An example of this situation is the second state in Figure 3d).</S>
          <S ID="S-7972">The word SUV in the third input hypothesis is left unvisited and it cannot be selected next because there is no adjacent state that can be generated.</S>
          <S ID="S-7973">For such cases, we need to compute an extra score of covering these leftover words.</S>
          <S ID="S-7974">Our approach is to create a state that produces the same output translation, but also covers all remaining words.</S>
          <S ID="S-7975">For each leftover word, we create a pseudo CS that contains just that word plus &#949;&#8217;s from all other hypotheses, and let it output &#949;. Moreover, that CS is inserted at a place such that no extra distortion cost is incurred.</S>
          <S ID="S-7976">Figure 4 shows an example using the second state in Figure 3d).</S>
          <S ID="S-7977">The last two words from the first two MT hypotheses &#8220;the Jeep&#8221; and &#8220;the SUV&#8221; align to the third and fifth words of the third hypothesis &#8220;the Jeep&#8221;; the word w 3,4 from the third hypothesis is left unvisited.</S>
          <S ID="S-7978">The original path has two CS and one left-over word w 3,4 .</S>
          <S ID="S-7979">It is expanded to have three CS, with a pseudo CS inserted between the two CS.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-7980">It is worth noting that the new inserted pseudo CS will not affect the word count feature and contextually dependent feature scores such as the LM and bi-gram voting, since it only generates an empty word.</S>
          <S ID="S-7981">Moreover, it will not affect the</S>
        </P>

          <S ID="S-7983">For example, as shown in Figure 4, the distortion cost of jumping from word w 2,3 to &#949; 2 and then to w 2,4 is the same as the cost of jumping from w 2,3 to w 2,4 given the way we assign position to empty word and the fact that the distortion cost is proportional to the difference between word positions.</S>

        <P>
          <S ID="S-7984">Scores of other features for this pseudo CS such as word posterior (of &#949;), alignment score, CS entropy, and CS count are all local scores and can be computed easily.</S>
          <S ID="S-7985">Unlike future scores which are approximate, the score computed in this process is exact.</S>
          <S ID="S-7986">Adding this extra score to the existing score accumulated in the final state gives the complete score of this finished path.</S>

      <HEADER>7 Discussion</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-8039">This paper proposed a joint optimization approach for word-level combination of translation hypotheses from multiple machine translation systems.</S>
        <S ID="S-8040">Unlike conventional confusion-network-based methods, alignments between words from different hypotheses are not pre-determined and flexible word orderings are allowed.</S>
        <S ID="S-8041">Decisions on word alignment between hypotheses, word ordering, and the lexical choice of the final output are made jointly according to a set of features in the decoding process.</S>
        <S ID="S-8042">A new set of features to model alignment and reordering behavior is also proposed.</S>
        <S ID="S-8043">The method is evaluated against state-of-the-art baselines on the NIST MT08 C2E task.</S>
        <S ID="S-8044">The joint decoding approach is shown to outperform baselines significantly.</S>
        <S ID="S-8045">Because of the complexity of search, a challenge for our approach is combining a large number of input hypotheses.</S>
        <S ID="S-8046">When N-best hypotheses from the same system are added, it is possible to pre-compute and fix the one-to-one word alignment among the same-system hypotheses; such pre-computation is reasonable given our observation that the disagreement among hypotheses from different systems is larger than that among hypotheses from the same system.</S>
        <S ID="S-8047">This will reduce the alignment search space to be the same as that for 1-best case.</S>
        <S ID="S-8048">We plan to study this setting in future work.</S>
        <S ID="S-8049">To further improve the performance of our approach we see the biggest opportunity in developing better estimates of future scores and incorporating additional features.</S>
        <S ID="S-8050">Beside potential performance improvement, they may help on more effective pruning and speed up the overall decoding process as well.</S>
