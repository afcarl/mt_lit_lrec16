      <P>
        <S ID="S-17276">Motivated by the idea that a translation lexicon induced from non parallel data can be applied to MT, a variety of prior research has tried to build a translation lexicon from non parallel or comparable data (<REF ID="R-19" RPTR="33">Rapp, 1995</REF>; <REF ID="R-04" RPTR="15">Fung and Yee, 1998</REF>; <REF ID="R-12" RPTR="25">Koehn and Knight, 2002</REF>; <REF ID="R-07" RPTR="18">Haghighi et al., 2008</REF>; <REF ID="R-05" RPTR="16">Garera et al., 2009</REF>; Bergsma and Van Durme, 2011; <REF ID="R-02" RPTR="2">Daum&#233; and Jagarlamudi, 2011</REF>; <REF ID="R-08" RPTR="19">Irvine and Callison-Burch, 2013</REF><REF ID="R-09" RPTR="21">Irvine and Callison-Burch, 2013</REF>b; <REF ID="R-08" RPTR="20">Irvine and Callison-Burch, 2013</REF><REF ID="R-09" RPTR="22">Irvine and Callison-Burch, 2013</REF>a).</S>

      <HEADER>3 From Adjacent Bigrams to Dependency Bigrams</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-17313">A major limitation of work by <REF ID="R-03" RPTR="10">Dou and Knight (2012)</REF> is their monotonic generative story for deciphering adjacent bigrams.</S>
        <S ID="S-17314">While the generation process works well for deciphering similar languages (e.g. Spanish and French) without considering reordering, it does not work well for languages that are more different in grammar and word order (e.g. Spanish and English).</S>
        <S ID="S-17315">In this section, we first look at why adjacent bigrams are bad for decipherment.</S>
        <S ID="S-17316">Then we describe how to use syntax to solve the problem.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-17317">The left column in Table 1 contains adjacent bigrams extracted from the Spanish phrase &#8220;misi&#243;n de naciones unidas en oriente medio&#8221;.</S>
        <S ID="S-17318">The correct decipherment for the bigram &#8220;naciones unidas&#8221; should be &#8220;united nations&#8221;.</S>
        <S ID="S-17319">Since the deciphering model described by <REF ID="R-03" RPTR="11">Dou and Knight (2012)</REF> does not consider word reordering, it needs to decipher the bigram into &#8220;nations united&#8221; in order to get the right word translations &#8220;naciones&#8221;&#8594;&#8220;nations&#8221; and &#8220;unidas&#8221;&#8594;&#8220;united&#8221;.</S>
        <S ID="S-17320">However, the English language model used for decipherment is built from English adjacent bigrams, so it strongly disprefers &#8220;nations united&#8221; and is not likely to produce a sensible decipherment for &#8220;naciones unidas&#8221;.</S>
        <S ID="S-17321">The Spanish bigram &#8220;oriente medio&#8221; poses the same problem.</S>
        <S ID="S-17322">Thus, without considering word reordering, the model described by <REF ID="R-03" RPTR="12">Dou and Knight (2012)</REF> is not a good fit for deciphering Spanish into English.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-17323">However, if we extract bigrams based on dependency relations for both languages, the model fits better.</S>
        <S ID="S-17324">To extract such bigrams, we first use dependency parsers to parse both languages, and extract bigrams by putting head word first, followed by the modifier.</S>
        <S ID="S-17325">1 We call these dependency bigrams.</S>
        <S ID="S-17326">The right column in Table 1 lists examples of Spanish dependency bigrams extracted from the same Spanish phrase.</S>
        <S ID="S-17327">With a language model built with English dependency bigrams, the same model used for deciphering adjacent bigrams is able to decipher Spanish dependency bigram &#8220;naciones(head) unidas(modifier)&#8221; into &#8220;nations(head) united(modifier)&#8221;.</S>
        <S ID="S-17328">We might instead propose to consider word reordering when deciphering adjacent bigrams (e.g. add an operation to swap tokens in a bigram).</S>
        <S ID="S-17329">However, using dependency bigrams has the following advantages:</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-17330">&#8226; First, using dependency bigrams avoids complicating the model, keeping deciphering efficient and scalable.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-17331">&#8226; Second, it addresses the problem of long distance reordering, which can not be modeled by swapping tokens in bigrams.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-17332">Furthermore, using dependency bigrams allows us to use dependency types to further</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-17333">1 As use of &#8220;del&#8221; and &#8220;de&#8221; in Spanish is much more frequent</S>

        <S ID="S-17334">than the use of &#8220;of&#8221; in English, we skip those words by using their head words as new heads if any of them serves as a head.</S>

        <S ID="S-17336">Suppose we have a Spanish dependency bigram &#8220;accept&#243;(verb) solicitud(object)&#8221;.</S>
        <S ID="S-17337">Then all of the following English dependency bigrams are possible decipherments: &#8220;accepted(verb) UN(subject)&#8221;, &#8220;accepted(verb) government(subject)&#8221;, &#8220;accepted(verb) request(object)&#8221;.</S>
        <S ID="S-17338">However, if we know the type of the Spanish dependency bigram and use a language model built with the same type in English, the only possible decipherment is &#8220;accepted(verb) request(object)&#8221;.</S>
        <S ID="S-17339">If we limit the search space, a system is more likely to find a better decipherment.</S>

          <S ID="S-17451">We analyze the results and find the gain mainly comes from two parts.</S>
          <S ID="S-17452">First, adding T decipher to small amounts of parallel corpus improves word level translation probabilities, which lead to better lexical weighting; second, T decipher contains new alternative translations for words observed in the parallel corpus.</S>
          <S ID="S-17453">Moreover, Decipher-OOV also achieves better BLEU scores compared with PBMT across all tuning and test sets.</S>
          <S ID="S-17454">We also observe that systems using T decipher learned by deciphering dependency bigrams leads to larger gains in BLEU scores.</S>
          <S ID="S-17455">When decipherment is used to improve translation of both observed and OOV words, we see improvement in BLEU score as high as 1.8 points on the 2010 news test set.</S>

        <P>
          <S ID="S-17456">The consistent improvement on the tuning and different testing data suggests that decipherment is capable of learning good translations for a number of OOV words.</S>
          <S ID="S-17457">To further demonstrate that our decipherment approach finds useful translations for OOV words, we list the top 10 most frequent OOV words from both the tuning set and testing set as well as their translations (up to three most likely translations) in Table 5.</S>
          <S ID="S-17458">P (e|f) and P (f|e) are average scores over different decipherment runs.</S>
          <S ID="S-17459">From the table, we can see that decipherment finds correct translations (bolded) for 7 out of the 10 most frequent OOV words.</S>
          <S ID="S-17460">Moreover, many OOVs and their correct translations are homographs , which makes copying OOVs directly to the output a strong baseline to beat.</S>
