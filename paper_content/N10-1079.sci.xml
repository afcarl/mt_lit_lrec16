      <P>
        <S ID="S-23271">Information technology advances have led to the need for more efficient translation methods.</S>
        <S ID="S-23272">Current MT systems are not able to produce ready-to-use texts.</S>
        <S ID="S-23273">Indeed, MT systems usually require human post-editing to achieve high-quality translations.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-23274">One way of taking advantage of MT systems is to combine them with the knowledge of a human translator in the IMT paradigm, which is a special type of the computer-assisted translation paradigm (<REF ID="R-07" RPTR="11">Isabelle and Church, 1997</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-23275">An important contribution to IMT technology was pioneered by the TransType project (<REF ID="R-06" RPTR="10">Foster et al., 1997</REF>; <REF ID="R-10" RPTR="16">Langlais et al., 2002</REF>) where data driven MT techniques were adapted for their use in an interactive translation environment.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-23276">Following the TransType ideas, <REF ID="R-01" RPTR="1">Barrachina et al. (2009)</REF> proposed a new approach to IMT, in which fully-fledged statistical MT (SMT) systems are used to produce full target sentence hypotheses, or portions thereof, which can be partially or completely accepted and amended by a human translator.</S>
        <S ID="S-23277">Each partial, correct text segment is then used by the SMT system as additional information to achieve improved suggestions.</S>
        <S ID="S-23278">Figure 1 illustrates a typical IMT session.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-23279">In this paper, we also focus on the IMT framework.</S>
        <S ID="S-23280">Specifically, we present an IMT system that is able to learn from user feedback.</S>
        <S ID="S-23281">For this purpose, we apply the online learning paradigm to the IMT framework.</S>
        <S ID="S-23282">The online learning techniques that we propose here allow the statistical models involved in the translation process to be incrementally updated.</S>

        <S ID="S-23286">The input sentence f and its desired translation &#234; can be used to refine the models used by the system.</S>

        <S ID="S-23303">Given a sentence f from a source language F to be translated into a target sentence e of a target language E, the fundamental equation of SMT (<REF ID="R-02" RPTR="6">Brown et al., 1993</REF>) is the following:</S>

        <S ID="S-23319">Current MT systems are based on the use of phrase-based models (<REF ID="R-09" RPTR="13">Koehn et al., 2003</REF>) as translation models.</S>
        <S ID="S-23320">The basic idea of Phrase-based Translation (PBT) is to segment the source sentence into phrases, then to translate each source phrase into a target phrase, and finally to reorder the translated target phrases in order to compose the target sentence.</S>
        <S ID="S-23321">If we summarize all the decisions made during the phrase-based translation process by means of the hidden variable &#227; K 1 , we obtain the expression:</S>

        <S ID="S-23327">According to Equation (4), and following a maximum approximation, the problem stated in Equation (2) can be reframed as:</S>

      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-23337">Thus, the search is restricted to those sentences e which contain e p as prefix.</S>
        <S ID="S-23338">It is also worth mentioning that the similarities between Equation (6) and Equation (5) (note that e p e s &#8801; e) allow us to use the same models whenever the search procedures are adequately modified (<REF ID="R-01" RPTR="2">Barrachina et al., 2009</REF>).</S>

        <S ID="S-23357">This constrained version of online learning is not able to extend the translation models due to technical problems with the efficiency of the learning process.</S>
        <S ID="S-23358">In this paper, we present a purely statistical IMT system which is able to incrementally update the parameters of all of the different models that are used in the system, including the translation model, breaking with the above mentioned constraints.</S>

      <P>
        <S ID="S-23544">We have presented an online IMT system.</S>
        <S ID="S-23545">The proposed system is able to incrementally extend the statistical models involved in the translation process, breaking technical limitations encountered in other works.</S>
        <S ID="S-23546">Empirical results show that our techniques allow the IMT system to learn from scratch or from previously estimated models.</S>
        <S ID="S-23547">One key aspect of the proposed system is the use of HMM-based alignment models trained by means of the incremental EM algorithm.</S>
        <S ID="S-23548">The incremental adjustment of the weights of the log-linear models and other parameters have not been tackled here.</S>
        <S ID="S-23549">For the future we plan to incorporate this functionality into our IMT system.</S>
        <S ID="S-23550">The incremental techniques proposed here can also be exploited to extend SMT systems (in fact, our proposed IMT system is based on an incrementally updateable SMT system).</S>
        <S ID="S-23551">For the near future we plan to study possible aplications of our techniques in a fully automatic translation scenario.</S>
        <S ID="S-23552">Finally, it is worthy of note that the main ideas presented here can be used in other interactive applications such as Computer Assisted Speech Transcription, Interactive Image Retrieval, etc (see (<REF ID="R-21" RPTR="29">Vidal et al., 2007</REF>) for more information).</S>
        <S ID="S-23553">In conclusion, we think that the online learning techniques proposed here can be the starting point for a new generation of interactive pattern recognition systems that are able to take advantage of user feedback.</S>
