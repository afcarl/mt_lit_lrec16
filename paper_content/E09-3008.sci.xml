      <P>
        <S ID="S-19132">In German, as in many other languages, compounds are normally written as single words without spaces or other word boundaries.</S>
        <S ID="S-19133">Compounds can be binary, i.e., made up of two parts (1a), or have more parts (1b).</S>
        <S ID="S-19134">There are also coordinated compound constructions (1c).</S>
        <S ID="S-19135">In a few cases compounds are written with a hyphen (1d), often when one of the parts is a proper name or an abbreviation.</S>

        <S ID="S-19141">German compounds can have English translations that are compounds, written as separate words (1a), other constructions, possibly with inserted function words and reordering (1b), or single words (1e).</S>
        <S ID="S-19142">Compound parts sometimes have special compound forms, formed by addition or truncations of letters, by umlaut or by a combination of these, as in (1a), where the letter -s is added to the first part, Regierung.</S>
        <S ID="S-19143">For an overview of German compound forms, see <REF ID="R-12" RPTR="13">Langer (1998)</REF>.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-19144">Compounds are productive and common in German and other Germanic languages, which makes them problematic for many applications including statistical machine translation.</S>
        <S ID="S-19145">For translation into a compounding language, fewer compounds than in normal texts are often produced, which can be due to the fact that the desired compounds are missing in the training data, or that they have not been aligned correctly.</S>
        <S ID="S-19146">Where a compound is the idiomatic word choice in the translation, a MT system can instead produce separate words, genitive or other alternative constructions, or only translate one part of the compound.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-19147">The most common way to integrate compound processing into statistical machine translation is to split compounds prior to training and translation.</S>
        <S ID="S-19148">Splitting of compounds has received a lot of focus in the literature, both for machine translation, and targeted at other applications such as information retrieval or speech recognition.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-19149">When translating into a compounding language there is a need to merge the split compounds after translation.</S>
        <S ID="S-19150">In order to do this we have to identify which words that should be merged into compounds, which is complicated by the fact that the translation process is not guaranteed to produce translations where compound parts are kept together.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-19151">In this article I explore the effects of merging in a factored phrase-based statistical machine translation system.</S>
        <S ID="S-19152">The system uses part-of-speech as an output factor.</S>
        <S ID="S-19153">This factor is used as a knowledge source for merging and to improve word order by using a part-of-speech (POS) sequence model.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-19154">There are different knowledge sources for merging.</S>
        <S ID="S-19155">Some are external, such as frequency lists of words, compounds, and compound parts, that could be compiled at split-time.</S>
        <S ID="S-19156">It is also possible to have internal knowledge sources, that are carried through the translation process, such as symbols on compound parts, or part-of-speech tags.</S>
        <S ID="S-19157">Choices made at split-time influence which internal knowledge sources are available at mergetime.</S>
        <S ID="S-19158">I will explore and compare three markup schemes for compound parts, and eight merging algorithms that use different combinations of knowledge sources.</S>

        <S ID="S-19159">Splitting German compounds into their parts prior to translation has been suggested by many researchers.</S>
        <S ID="S-19160"><REF ID="R-08" RPTR="9">Koehn and Knight (2003)</REF> presented an empirical splitting algorithm that is used to improve translation from German to English.</S>
        <S ID="S-19161">They split all words in all possible places, and considered a splitting option valid if all the parts are existing words in a monolingual corpus.</S>
        <S ID="S-19162">They allowed the addition of -s or -es at all splitting points.</S>
        <S ID="S-19163">If there were several valid splitting options they chose one based on the number of splits, the geometric mean of part frequencies or based on alignment data.</S>
        <S ID="S-19164"><REF ID="R-20" RPTR="27">Stymne (2008)</REF> extended this algorithm in a number of ways, for instance by allowing more compound forms.</S>
        <S ID="S-19165">She found that for translation into German, it was better to use the arithmetic mean of part frequencies than the geometric mean.</S>
        <S ID="S-19166">Using the mean of frequencies can result in no split, if the compound is more frequent than its parts.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-19167">Merging has been much less explored than splitting since it is common only to discuss translation from compounding languages.</S>
        <S ID="S-19168">However, <REF ID="R-16" RPTR="19">Popovi&#263; et al. (2006)</REF><REF ID="R-04" RPTR="3">(2006)</REF> used merging for translation into German.</S>
        <S ID="S-19169">They did not mark compound parts in any way, so the merging is based on two word lists, with compound parts and full compounds found at split-time.</S>
        <S ID="S-19170">All words in the translation output that were possible compound parts were merged with the next word if it resulted in a known compound.</S>
        <S ID="S-19171">They only discussed merging of binary compounds.</S>
        <S ID="S-19172">The drawback of this method is that novel compounds cannot be merged.</S>
        <S ID="S-19173">Nevertheless, this strategy led to improved translation measured by three automatic metrics.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-19174">In a study of translation between English and Swedish, <REF ID="R-19" RPTR="25">Stymne and Holmqvist (2008)</REF> suggested a merging algorithm based on part-of-speech, which can be used in a factored translation system with part-of-speech as an output factor.</S>
        <S ID="S-19175">Compound parts had special part-of-speech tags based on the head of the compound, and merging was performed if that part-of-speech tag matched that of the following word.</S>
        <S ID="S-19176">When compound forms had been normalized the correct compound form was found by using frequency lists of parts and words compiled at split-time.</S>
        <S ID="S-19177">This method can merge unseen compounds, and the tendency to merge too much is reduced by the restriction that POS-tags need to match.</S>
        <S ID="S-19178">In addition coordinated compounds were handled by the algorithm.</S>
        <S ID="S-19179">This strategy resulted in improved scores on automatic metrics, which were confirmed by an error analysis.</S>

        <S ID="S-19184">Some work has discussed merging of not only compounds, but of all morphs.</S>
        <S ID="S-19185">Virpioja et al. (2007) merged translation output that was split into morphs for Finnish, Swedish and Danish.</S>
        <S ID="S-19186">They marked split parts with a symbol, and merged every word in the output which had this symbol with the next word.</S>

        <S ID="S-19270">In the current system part-ofspeech is used only as an output factor in the target language.</S>
        <S ID="S-19271">Besides the standard language model a sequence model on part-of-speech is used, which can be expected to lead to better word order in the translation output.</S>

        <S ID="S-19273">In addition, the computational overhead is small.</S>

      <HEADER>7 Conclusion and Future Work</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-19377">In this study I have shown that the strategy used for merging German compound parts in translation output influences translation results to a large extent.</S>
        <S ID="S-19378">For merging to be successful, it needs some internal knowledge source, carried through the translation process, such as symbols or partof- speech.</S>
        <S ID="S-19379">The overall best results were achieved by using matching for part-of-speech.</S>
        <S ID="S-19380">One factor that affects merging, which was not explored in this work, is the quality of splitting.</S>
        <S ID="S-19381">If splitting produces less erroneously split compounds than the current method, it is possible that merging also can produce better results, even though it was not clear from the error analysis that bad splits were a problem.</S>
        <S ID="S-19382">A number of more accurate splitting strategies have been suggested for different tasks, see e.g. Alfonseca et al. (2008), that could be explored in combination with merging for machine translation.</S>
        <S ID="S-19383">I have compared the performance of different merging strategies in one language, German.</S>
        <S ID="S-19384">It would be interesting to investigate these methods for other compounding languages as well.</S>
        <S ID="S-19385">I also want to explore translation between two compounding languages, where splitting and merging would be performed on both languages, not only on one language as in this study.</S>
