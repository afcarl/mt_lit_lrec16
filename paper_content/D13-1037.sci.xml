  <ABSTRACT>
    <A-S ID="S-14551">This paper addresses the task of predicting the correct French translations of third-person subject pronouns in English discourse, a problem that is relevant as a prerequisite for machine translation and that requires anaphora resolution.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-14552">We present an approach based on neural networks that models anaphoric links as latent variables and show that its performance is competitive with that of a system with separate anaphora resolution while not requiring any coreference-annotated training data.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-14553">This demonstrates that the information contained in parallel bitexts can successfully be used to acquire knowledge about pronominal anaphora in an unsupervised way.</A-S>

      <HEADER>1 Motivation</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-14554">When texts are translated from one language into another, the translation reconstructs the meaning or function of the source text with the means of the target language.</S>
        <S ID="S-14555">Generally, this has the effect that the entities occurring in the translation and their mutual relations will display similar patterns as the entities in the source text.</S>
        <S ID="S-14556">In particular, coreference patterns tend to be very similar in translations of a text, and this fact has been exploited with good results to project coreference annotations from one language into another by using word alignments (<REF ID="R-19" RPTR="18">Postolache et al., 2006</REF>; <REF ID="R-20" RPTR="21">Rahman and Ng, 2012</REF>).</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-14557">On the other hand, what is true in general need not be true for all types of linguistic elements.</S>
        <S ID="S-14558">For instance, a substantial percentage of the English thirdperson subject pronouns he, she, it and they does not get realised as pronouns in French translations (<REF ID="R-12" RPTR="12">Hardmeier, 2012</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-14559">Moreover, it has been recognised by various authors in the statistical machine translation (SMT) community (Le Nagard and Koehn, 2010; <REF ID="R-11" RPTR="10">Hardmeier and Federico, 2010</REF>; <REF ID="R-10" RPTR="8">Guillou, 2012</REF>) that pronoun translation is a difficult problem because, even when a pronoun does get translated as a pronoun, it may require choosing the correct word form based on agreement features that are not easily predictable from the source text.</S>
        <S ID="S-14560">The work presented in this paper investigates the problem of cross-lingual pronoun prediction for English-French.</S>
        <S ID="S-14561">Given an English pronoun and its discourse context as well as a French translation of the same discourse and word alignments between the two languages, we attempt to predict the French word aligned to the English pronoun.</S>
        <S ID="S-14562">As far as we know, this task has not been addressed in the literature before.</S>
        <S ID="S-14563">In our opinion, it is interesting for several reasons.</S>
        <S ID="S-14564">By studying pronoun prediction as a task in its own right, we hope to contribute towards a better understanding of pronoun translation with a longterm view to improving the performance of SMT systems.</S>
        <S ID="S-14565">Moreover, we believe that this task can lead to interesting insights about anaphora resolution in a multi-lingual context.</S>
        <S ID="S-14566">In particular, we show in this paper that the pronoun prediction task makes it possible to model the resolution of pronominal anaphora as a latent variable and opens up a way to solve a task relying on anaphora resolution without using any data annotated for anaphora.</S>
        <S ID="S-14567">This is what we consider the main contribution of our present work.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-14568">We start by modelling cross-lingual pronoun prediction as an independent machine learning task after doing anaphora resolution in the source language (English) using the BART software (<REF ID="R-01" RPTR="1">Broscheit et al., 2010</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-14569">We show that it is difficult to achieve satisfactory performance with standard maximum-</S>

        <S ID="S-14573">We propose a neural network classifier that achieves better precision and recall and manages to make reasonable predictions for all pronoun categories in many cases.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-14574">We then go on to extend our neural network architecture to include anaphoric links as latent variables.</S>
        <S ID="S-14575">We demonstrate that our classifier, now with its own source language anaphora resolver, can be trained successfully with backpropagation.</S>
        <S ID="S-14576">In this setup, we no longer use the machine learning component included in the external coreference resolution system (BART) to predict anaphoric links.</S>
        <S ID="S-14577">Anaphora resolution is done by our neural network classifier and requires only some quantity of word-aligned parallel data for training, completely obviating the need for a coreference-annotated training set.</S>

      <HEADER>2 Task Setup</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-14578">The overall setup of the classification task we address in this paper is shown in Figure 1.</S>
        <S ID="S-14579">We are given an English discourse containing a pronoun along with its French translation and word alignments between the two languages, which in our case were computed automatically using a standard SMT pipeline with GIZA++ (<REF ID="R-17" RPTR="16">Och and Ney, 2003</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-14580">We focus on the four English third-person subject pronouns he, she, it and they.</S>
        <S ID="S-14581">The output of the classifier is a multinomial distribution over six classes: the four French subject pronouns il, elle, ils and elles, corresponding to masculine and feminine singular and plural, respectively; the impersonal pronoun ce/c&#8217;, which occurs in some very frequent constructions such as c&#8217;est (it is); and a sixth class OTHER, which indicates that none of these pronouns was used.</S>
        <S ID="S-14582">In general, a pronoun may be aligned to multiple words; in this case, a training example is counted as a positive example for a class if the target word occurs among the words aligned to the pronoun, irrespective of the presence of other</S>

        <S ID="S-14591">This task setup resembles the problem that an SMT system would have to solve to make informed choices when translating pronouns, an aspect of translation neglected by most existing SMT systems.</S>
        <S ID="S-14592">An important difference between the SMT setup and our own classifiers is that we use context from humanmade translations for prediction.</S>
        <S ID="S-14593">This potentially makes the task both easier and more difficult; easier, because the context can be relied on to be correctly translated, and more difficult, because human translators frequently create less literal translations than an SMT system would.</S>
        <S ID="S-14594">Integrating pronoun prediction into the translation process would require significant changes to the standard SMT decoding setup in order to take long-range dependencies in the target language into account, which is why we do not address this issue in our current work.</S>

      <P>
        <S ID="S-14595">In all the experiments presented in this paper, we used features from two different sources:</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-14596">&#8211; Anaphora context features describe the source language pronoun and its immediate context consisting of three words to its left and three words to its right.</S>
        <S ID="S-14597">They are encoded as vectors whose dimensionality is equal to the source vocabulary size with a single non-zero component indicating the word referred to (one-hot vectors).</S>
        <S ID="S-14598">&#8211; Antecedent features describe an antecedent candidate.</S>
        <S ID="S-14599">Antecedent candidates are represented by the target language words aligned to the syntactic head of the source language markable</S>

        <S ID="S-14602">The different handling of anaphora context features and antecedent features is due to the fact that we always consider a constant number of context words on the source side, whereas the number of word vectors to be considered depends on the number of antecedent candidates and on the number of target words aligned to each antecedent.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-14603">The encoding of the antecedent features is illustrated in Figure 2 for a training example with two antecedent candidates translated to elle and la version, respectively.</S>
        <S ID="S-14604">The target words are represented as one-hot vectors with the dimensionality of the target language vocabulary.</S>
        <S ID="S-14605">These vectors are then averaged to yield a single vector per antecedent candidate.</S>
        <S ID="S-14606">Finally, the vectors of all candidates for a given training example are weighted by the probabilities assigned to them by the anaphora resolver (p 1 and p 2 ) and summed to yield a single vector per training example.</S>

        <S ID="S-14617">One thing to note is the dominance of the OTHER class, which pools together such different phenomena as translations with other pronouns not in our list (e. g., celui-ci) and translations with full noun phrases instead of pronouns.</S>

        <S ID="S-14620">Some of our experiments also rely on an external anaphora resolution component.</S>
        <S ID="S-14621">We use the open-source anaphora resolver BART to generate this information.</S>
        <S ID="S-14622">BART (<REF ID="R-01" RPTR="2">Broscheit et al., 2010</REF>) is an anaphora resolution toolkit consisting of a markable detection and feature extraction pipeline based on a variety of standard natural language processing (NLP) tools and a machine learning component to predict coreference links including both pronominal anaphora and noun-noun coreference.</S>
        <S ID="S-14623">In our experiments, we always use BART&#8217;s markable detection and feature extraction machinery.</S>
        <S ID="S-14624">Markable detection is based on the identification of noun phrases in constituency parses generated with the Stanford parser (<REF ID="R-13" RPTR="13">Klein and Manning, 2003</REF>).</S>

      <P>
        <S ID="S-14657">In the previous section, we saw that a simple multiclass maximum entropy classifier, while making correct predictions for much of the data set, has a significant bias towards making majority class decisions, relying more on prior assumptions about the frequency distribution of the classes than on antecedent features when handling examples of less frequent classes.</S>
        <S ID="S-14658">In order to create a system that can be trained to rely more explicitly on antecedent information, we created a neural network classifier for our task.</S>
        <S ID="S-14659">The introduction of a hidden layer should enable the classifier to learn abstract concepts such as gender and number that are useful across multiple output categories, so that the performance of sparsely represented classes can benefit from the training examples of the more frequent classes.</S>

        <S ID="S-14660">The overall structure of the network is shown in Figure 3.</S>
        <S ID="S-14661">As inputs, the network takes the same features that were available to the baseline ME classifier, based on the source pronoun (P) with three words of context to its left (L1 to L3) and three words to its right (R1 to R3) as well as the words aligned to the syntactic head words of all possible antecedent candidates as found by BART (A).</S>

      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-14665">The network has two hidden layers.</S>
        <S ID="S-14666">The first layer (E) maps the input word vectors to a low-dimensional representation.</S>
        <S ID="S-14667">In this layer, the embedding weights for all the source language vectors (the pronoun and its 6 context words) are tied, so if two words are the same, they are mapped to the same lowerdimensional embedding irrespective of their position relative to the pronoun.</S>
        <S ID="S-14668">The embedding of the antecedent word vectors is independent, as these word vectors represent target language words.</S>
        <S ID="S-14669">The entire embedding layer is then mapped to another hidden layer (H), which is in turn connected to a softmax output layer (S) with 6 outputs representing the classes ce, elle, elles, il, ils and OTHER.</S>
        <S ID="S-14670">The non-linearity of both hidden layers is the logistic sigmoid function, f (x) = 1/(1 + e &#8722;x ).</S>

      <P>
        <S ID="S-14671">In all experiments reported in this paper, the dimensionality of the source and target language word embeddings is 20, resulting in a total embedding layer size of 160, and the size of the last hidden layer is equal to 50.</S>
        <S ID="S-14672">These sizes are fairly small.</S>

        <S ID="S-14675">3 In contrast to standard gradient descent, RMSPROP normalises the magnitude of the gradient components by dividing them by a root-mean-square moving average.</S>
        <S ID="S-14676">We found this led to faster convergence.</S>
        <S ID="S-14677">Other features of our training algorithm include the use of momentum to even out gradient oscillations, adaptive learning rates for each weight as well as adaptation of the global learning rate as a function of current training progress.</S>

        <S ID="S-14679">Good settings of the initial learning rate and the weight cost parameter (both around 0.001 in most experiments) were found by manual experimentation.</S>
        <S ID="S-14680">Generally, we train our networks for 300 epochs, compute the validation error on a held-out set of some 10 % of the training data after each epoch and use the model that achieved the lowest validation error for testing.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-14681">Since the source context features are very informative and it is comparatively more difficult to learn from the antecedents, the network sometimes had a tendency to overfit to the source features and disregard antecedent information.</S>
        <S ID="S-14682">We found that this problem can be solved effectively by presenting a part of the training without any source features, forcing the network to learn from the information contained in the antecedents.</S>
        <S ID="S-14683">In all experiments in this paper, we zero out all source features (input layers P, L1 to L3 and R1 to R3) with a probability of 50 % in each training example.</S>

      <P>
        <S ID="S-14694">Considering Figure 1 again, we note that the bilingual setting of our classification task adds some information not available to the monolingual anaphora resolver that can be helpful when determining the correct antecedent for a given pronoun.</S>
        <S ID="S-14695">Knowing the gender of the translation of a pronoun limits the set of possible antecedents to those whose translation is morphologically compatible with the target language pronoun.</S>
        <S ID="S-14696">We can exploit this fact to learn how to resolve anaphoric pronouns without requiring data with manually annotated anaphoric links.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-14697">To achieve this, we extend our neural network with a component to predict the probability of each antecedent candidate to be the correct antecedent (Figure 4).</S>
        <S ID="S-14698">The extended network is identical to the previous version except for the upper left part dealing with anaphoric link features.</S>
        <S ID="S-14699">The only difference between the two networks is the fact that anaphora resolution is now performed by a part of our neural network itself instead of being done by an external module and provided to the classifier as an input.</S>

        <S ID="S-14700">In this setup, we still use some parts of the BART toolkit to extract markables and compute features.</S>
        <S ID="S-14701">However, we do not make use of the machine learning component in BART that makes the actual predictions.</S>
        <S ID="S-14702">Since this is the only component trained on coreference-annotated data in a typical BART configuration, no coreference annotations are used anywhere in our system even though we continue to rely on the external anaphora resolver for preprocessing to avoid implementing our own markable and feature extractors and to make comparison easier.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-14703">For each candidate markable identified by BART&#8217;s preprocessing pipeline, the anaphora resolution model receives as input a link feature vector (T) describing relevant aspects of the antecedent candidateanaphora pair.</S>

        <S ID="S-14717">Note that the number of weights in the network is the same for all training examples even though the number of antecedent candidates varies because all weights related to antecedent word features and anaphoric link features are shared between all antecedent candidates.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-14718">One slightly uncommon feature of our neural network is that it contains an internal softmax layer to generate normalised probabilities over all possible antecedent candidates.</S>
        <S ID="S-14719">Moreover, weights are shared between all antecedent candidates, so the inputs of our internal softmax layer share dependencies on the same weight variables.</S>

      <HEADER>7 Further Improvements</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-14768">The results presented in the preceding section represent a clear improvement over the ME classifiers in Table 2, even though the overall accuracy increased only slightly.</S>
        <S ID="S-14769">Not only does our neural network classifier achieve better results on the classification task at hand without requiring an anaphora resolution classifier trained on manually annotated data, but it performs clearly better for the feminine categories that reflect minority choices requiring knowledge about the antecedents.</S>
        <S ID="S-14770">Nevertheless, the performance is still not entirely satisfactory.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-14771">By subjecting the output of our classifier on a development set to a manual error analysis, we found that a fairly large number of errors belong to two error types: On the one hand, the preprocessing pipeline used to identify antecedent candidates does not always include the correct antecedent in the set presented to the neural network.</S>
        <S ID="S-14772">Whenever this occurs, it is obvious that the classifier cannot possibly find the correct antecedent.</S>
        <S ID="S-14773">Out of 76 examples of the category elles that had been mistakenly predicted as ils, we found that 43 suffered from this problem.</S>
        <S ID="S-14774">In other classes, the problem seems to be somewhat less common, but it still exists.</S>
        <S ID="S-14775">On the other hand, in many cases (23 out of 76 for the category mentioned before) the anaphora resolution subnetwork does identify an antecedent manually recognised to belong to the right gender/number group, but still predicts an incorrect pronoun.</S>
        <S ID="S-14776">This may indicate that the network has difficulties learning a correct gender/number representation for all words in the vocabulary.</S>
      </P>
      <DIV DEPTH="1">
        <HEADER>7.1 Relaxing Markable Extraction</HEADER>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-14736">The pipeline we use to extract potential antecedent candidates is borrowed from the BART anaphora resolution toolkit.</S>
          <S ID="S-14737">BART uses a syntactic parser to identify noun phrases as markables.</S>
          <S ID="S-14738">When extracting antecedent candidates for coreference prediction, it starts by considering a window consisting of the sentence in which the anaphoric pronoun is located and the two immediately preceding sentences.</S>
          <S ID="S-14739">Markables in this window are checked for morphological compatibility in terms of gender and number with the anaphoric pronoun, and only compatible markables are extracted as antecedent candidates.</S>
          <S ID="S-14740">If no compatible markables are found in the initial window, the window is successively enlarged one sentence at a time until at least one suitable markable is found.</S>
          <S ID="S-14741">Our error analysis shows that this procedure misses some relevant markables both because the initial two-sentence extraction window is too small and because the morphological compatibility check incorrectly filters away some markables that should have been considered as candidates.</S>
          <S ID="S-14742">By contrast, the extraction procedure does extract quite a number of first and second person noun phrases (I, we, you and their oblique forms) in the TED talks which are extremely unlikely to be the antecedent of a later occurrence of he, she, it or they.</S>
          <S ID="S-14743">As a first step, we therefore adjust the extraction criteria to our task by increasing the initial extraction window to five sentences, excluding first and second person markables and removing the morphological compatibility requirement.</S>
          <S ID="S-14744">The compatibility check is still used to control expansion of the extraction window, but it is no longer applied to filter the extracted markables.</S>
          <S ID="S-14745">This increases the accuracy to 0.701 for TED and 0.602 for the news</S>

          <S ID="S-14751">Note that these and all the following results are not directly comparable to the ME baseline results in Table 2, since they include modifications and improvements to the training data extraction procedure that might possibly lead to benefits in the ME setting as well.</S>

        <HEADER>7.2 Adding Lexicon Knowledge</HEADER>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-14752">In order to make it easier for the classifier to identify the gender and number properties of infrequent words, we extend the word vectors with features indicating possible morphological features for each word.</S>
          <S ID="S-14753">In early experiments with ME classifiers, we found that our attempts to do proper gender and number tagging in French text did not improve classification performance noticeably, presumably because the annotation was too noisy.</S>
          <S ID="S-14754">In more recent experiments, we just add features indicating all possible morphological interpretations of each word, rather than trying to disambiguate them.</S>
          <S ID="S-14755">To do this, we look up the morphological annotations of the French words in the Lefff dictionary (Sagot et al., 2006) and introduce a set of new binary features to indicate whether a particular reading of a word occurs in that dictionary.</S>
          <S ID="S-14756">These features are then added to the one-hot representation of the antecedent words.</S>
          <S ID="S-14757">Doing so improves the classifier accuracy to 0.711 (TED) and 0.604 (News commentaries), while the F-scores for elles reach 0.589 (TED; P 0.649, R 0.539) and 0.500 (News commentaries; P 0.545, R 0.462), respectively.</S>

        <HEADER>7.3 More Anaphoric Link Features</HEADER>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-14758">Even though the modified antecedent candidate extraction with its larger context window and without the morphological filter results in better performance on both test sets, additional error analysis reveals that the classifiers has greater problems identifying the correct markable in this setting.</S>
          <S ID="S-14759">One reason for this may be that the baseline anaphoric link feature set described above (Section 6) only includes two very rough binary distance features which indicate whether or not the anaphora and the antecedent candidate occur in the same or in immediately adjacent sentences.</S>
          <S ID="S-14760">With the larger context window, this may be too unspecific.</S>
          <S ID="S-14761">In our final experiment, we therefore enable some additional features which are available in BART, but disabled in the baseline system:</S>

          <S ID="S-14763">Complete results for this final system are presented in Table 5.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-14764">Including these additional features leads to another slight increase in accuracy for both corpora, with similar or increased classifier F-scores for most classes except elle in the news commentary condition.</S>
          <S ID="S-14765">In particular, we should like to point out the performance of our benchmark classifier for elles, which suffered from extremely low recall in the first classifiers and approaches the performance of the other classes, with nearly balanced precision and recall, in this final system.</S>
          <S ID="S-14766">Since elles is a low-frequency class and cannot be reliably predicted using source context alone, we interpret this as evidence that our final neural network classifier has incorporated some relevant knowledge about pronominal anaphora that the baseline ME classifier and earlier versions of our network have no access to.</S>
          <S ID="S-14767">This is particularly remarkable because no data manually annotated for coreference was used for training.</S>

      <HEADER>9 Conclusion</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-14787">In this paper, we have introduced cross-lingual pronoun prediction as an independent natural language processing task.</S>
        <S ID="S-14788">Even though it is not an end-to-end task, pronoun prediction is interesting for several reasons.</S>
        <S ID="S-14789">It is related to the problem of pronoun translation in SMT, a currently unsolved problem that has been addressed in a number of recent research publications (Le Nagard and Koehn, 2010; <REF ID="R-11" RPTR="11">Hardmeier and Federico, 2010</REF>; <REF ID="R-10" RPTR="9">Guillou, 2012</REF>) without reaching a major breakthrough.</S>
        <S ID="S-14790">In this work, we have shown that pronoun prediction can be effectively modelled in a neural network architecture with relatively simple features.</S>
        <S ID="S-14791">More importantly, we have demonstrated that the task can be exploited to train a classifier with a latent representation of anaphoric links.</S>
        <S ID="S-14792">With parallel text as its only supervision this classifier achieves a level of performance that is similar to, if not better than, that of a classifier using a regular anaphora resolution system trained with manually annotated data.</S>
