      <P>
        <S ID="S-18139">Phrase-based Statistical Machine Translation has proven to be a robust and effective approach to machine translation, providing good performance without the need for explicit linguistic information.</S>
        <S ID="S-18140">Phrase-based SMT systems, however, have limited capabilities in dealing with long distance phenomena, since they rely on local alignments.</S>
        <S ID="S-18141">Automatically learned reordering models, which can be conditioned on lexical items from both the source and the target, provide some limited reordering capability when added to SMT systems.</S>
        <S ID="S-18142">One approach that explicitly deals with long distance reordering is to reorder the source side to better match the target side, using predefined rules.</S>
        <S ID="S-18143">The reordered source is then used as input to the phrase-based SMT system.</S>
        <S ID="S-18144">This approach indirectly incorporates structure information since the reordering rules are applied on the parse trees of the source sentence.</S>
        <S ID="S-18145">Obviously, the same reordering has to be applied to both training data and test data.</S>
        <S ID="S-18146">Despite the added complexity of parsing the data, this technique has shown improvements, especially when good parses of the source side exist.</S>
        <S ID="S-18147">It has been successfully applied to German-to- English and Chinese-to-English SMT (<REF ID="R-03" RPTR="6">Collins et al., 2005</REF>; <REF ID="R-12" RPTR="18">Wang et al., 2007</REF>).</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-18148">In this paper, we propose the use of a similar approach for English-to-Arabic SMT.</S>
        <S ID="S-18149">Unlike most other work on Arabic translation, our work is in the direction of the more morphologically complex language, which poses unique challenges.</S>
        <S ID="S-18150">We propose a set of syntactic reordering rules on the English source to align it better to the Arabic target.</S>
        <S ID="S-18151">The reordering rules exploit systematic differences between the syntax of Arabic and the syntax of English; they specifically address two syntactic constructs.</S>
        <S ID="S-18152">The first is the Subject-Verb order in independent sentences, where the preferred order in written Arabic is Verb-Subject.</S>
        <S ID="S-18153">The second is the noun phrase structure, where many differences exist between the two languages, among them the order of adjectives, compound nouns and genitive constructs, as well as the way definiteness is marked.</S>
        <S ID="S-18154">The implementation of these rules is fairly straightforward since they are applied to the parse tree.</S>
        <S ID="S-18155">It has been noted in previous work (<REF ID="R-15" RPTR="21">Habash, 2007</REF>) that syntactic reordering does not improve translation if the parse quality is not good enough.</S>
        <S ID="S-18156">Since in this paper our source language is English, the parses are more reliable, and result in more correct reorderings.</S>
        <S ID="S-18157">We show that using the reordering rules results in gains in the translation scores and study the effect of the training data size on those gains.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-18158">This paper also investigates the effect of using morphological segmentation of the Arabic target</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-18159">in combination with the reordering rules.</S>
        <S ID="S-18160">Morphological segmentation has been shown to benefit Arabic-to-English (<REF ID="R-17" RPTR="27">Habash and Sadat, 2006</REF>) and English-to-Arabic (<REF ID="R-01" RPTR="2">Badr et al., 2008</REF>) translation, although the gains tend to decrease with increasing training data size.</S>

        <S ID="S-18162">It describes the rich morphology of Arabic, and its implications on SMT.</S>
        <S ID="S-18163">It also describes the syntax of the verb phrase and noun phrase in Arabic, and how they differ from their English counterparts.</S>
        <S ID="S-18164">In Section 3, we describe some of the relevant previous work.</S>
        <S ID="S-18165">In Section 4, we present the preprocessing techniques used in the experiments.</S>

        <HEADER>2.1 Arabic Morphology</HEADER>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-18168">Arabic has a complex morphology compared to English.</S>
          <S ID="S-18169">The Arabic noun and adjective are inflected for gender and number; the verb is inflected in addition for tense, voice, mood and person.</S>
          <S ID="S-18170">Various clitics can attach to words as well: Conjunctions, prepositions and possessive pronouns attach to nouns, and object pronouns attach to verbs.</S>
          <S ID="S-18171">The example below shows the decomposition into stems and clitics of the Arabic verb phrase wsyqAblhm 1 and noun phrase wbydh, both of which are written as one word:</S>

        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-18174">An Arabic corpus will, therefore, have more surface forms than an equivalent English corpus, and will also be sparser.</S>
          <S ID="S-18175">In the LDC news corpora used in this paper (see Section 5.2), the average English sentence length is 33 words compared to the Arabic 25 words.</S>

        <P>
          <S ID="S-18177">Although the Arabic language family consists of many dialects, none of them has a standard orthography.</S>
          <S ID="S-18178">This affects the consistency of the orthography of Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), the only written variety of Arabic.</S>
          <S ID="S-18179">Certain characters are written inconsistently in different data sources: Final &#8217;y&#8217; is sometimes written as &#8217;Y&#8217; (Alif mqSwrp), and initial Alif hamza (The Buckwalter characters &#8217;&lt;&#8217; and &#8217;{&#8217;) are written as bare alif (A).</S>
          <S ID="S-18180">Arabic is usually written without the diacritics that denote short vowels.</S>
          <S ID="S-18181">This creates an ambiguity at the word level, since a word can have more than one reading.</S>
          <S ID="S-18182">These factors adversely affect the performance of Arabic-to-English SMT, especially in the English-to-Arabic direction.</S>
          <S ID="S-18183">Simple pattern matching is not enough to perform morphological analysis and decomposition, since a certain string of characters can, in principle, be either an affixed morpheme or part of the base word itself.</S>
          <S ID="S-18184">Word-level linguistic information as well as context analysis are needed.</S>
          <S ID="S-18185">For example the written form wly can mean either ruler or and for me, depending on the context.</S>
          <S ID="S-18186">Only in the latter case should it be decomposed.</S>

      <P>
        <S ID="S-18220">Most of the work in Arabic machine translation is done in the Arabic-to-English direction.</S>
        <S ID="S-18221">The other direction, however, is also important, since it opens the wealth of information in different domains that is available in English to the Arabic speaking world.</S>
        <S ID="S-18222">Also, since Arabic is a morphologically richer language, translating into Arabic poses unique issues that are not present in the opposite direction.</S>
        <S ID="S-18223">The only works on Englishto-Arabic SMT that we are aware of are <REF ID="R-01" RPTR="1">Badr et al. (2008)</REF>, and <REF ID="R-10" RPTR="14">Sarikaya and Deng (2007)</REF>.</S>
        <S ID="S-18224">Badr et al. show that using segmentation and recombination as pre- and post- processing steps leads to significant gains especially for smaller training data corpora.</S>
        <S ID="S-18225">Sarikaya and Deng use Joint Morphological-Lexical Language Models to rerank the output of an English-to-Arabic MT system.</S>
        <S ID="S-18226">They use regular expression-based segmentation of the Arabic so as not to run into recombination issues on the output side.</S>
        <S ID="S-18227">Similarly, for Arabic-to-English, Lee (2004), and <REF ID="R-17" RPTR="26">Habash and Sadat (2006)</REF> show that various segmentation schemes lead to improvements that decrease with increasing parallel corpus size.</S>
        <S ID="S-18228">They use a trigram language model and the Arabic morphological analyzer MADA (<REF ID="R-16" RPTR="24">Habash and Rambow, 2005</REF>) respectively, to segment the Arabic side of their corpora.</S>
        <S ID="S-18229">Other work on Arabicto-English SMT tries to address the word reordering problem.</S>
        <S ID="S-18230"><REF ID="R-15" RPTR="23">Habash (2007)</REF> automatically learns syntactic reordering rules that are then applied to the Arabic side of the parallel corpora.</S>
        <S ID="S-18231">The words are aligned in a sentence pair, then the Arabic sentence is parsed to extract reordering rules based on how the constituents in the parse tree are reordered on the English side.</S>
        <S ID="S-18232">No significant improvement is</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-18233">shown with reordering when compared to a baseline that uses a non-lexicalized distance reordering model.</S>
        <S ID="S-18234">This is attributed in the paper to the poor quality of parsing.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-18235">Syntax-based reordering as a preprocessing step has been applied to many language pairs other than English-Arabic.</S>
        <S ID="S-18236">Most relevant to the approach in this paper are <REF ID="R-03" RPTR="5">Collins et al. (2005)</REF> and <REF ID="R-12" RPTR="16">Wang et al. (2007)</REF>.</S>
        <S ID="S-18237">Both parse the source side and then reorder the sentence based on predefined, linguistically motivated rules.</S>
        <S ID="S-18238">Significant gain is reported for German-to-English and Chinese-to-English translation.</S>
        <S ID="S-18239">Both suggest that reordering as a preprocessing step results in better alignment, and reduces the reliance on the distortion model.</S>
        <S ID="S-18240"><REF ID="R-08" RPTR="12">Popovic and Ney (2006)</REF> use similar methods to reorder German by looking at the POS tags for German-to-English and German-to- Spanish.</S>
        <S ID="S-18241">They show significant improvements on test set sentences that do get reordered as well as those that don&#8217;t, which is attributed to the improvement of the extracted phrases.</S>
        <S ID="S-18242">(<REF ID="R-13" RPTR="19">Xia and McCord, 2004</REF>) present a similar approach, with a notable difference: the re-ordering rules are automatically learned from aligning parse trees for both the source and target sentences.</S>
        <S ID="S-18243">They report a 10% relative gain for English-to-French translation.</S>
        <S ID="S-18244">Although target-side parsing is optional in this approach, it is needed to take full advantage of the approach.</S>
        <S ID="S-18245">This is a bigger issue when no reliable parses are available for the target language, as is the case in this paper.</S>
        <S ID="S-18246">More generally, the use of automatically-learned rules has the advantage of readily applicable to different language pairs.</S>
        <S ID="S-18247">The use of deterministic, pre-defined rules, however, has the advantage of being linguistically motivated, since differences between the two languages are addressed explicitly.</S>
        <S ID="S-18248">Moreover, the implementation of pre-defined transfer rules based on target-side parses is relatively easy and cheap to implement in different language pairs.</S>

        <S ID="S-18252">Tighter integration of features is claimed to allow for better modeling of the morphology and hence is better than using pre-processing and post-processing techniques.</S>

        <S ID="S-18254">Although Factored Models are well equipped for handling languages that differ in terms of morphology, they still use the same distortion reordering model as a phrasebased MT system.</S>

          <S ID="S-18256">In this paper, we use segmented and non-segmented Arabic on the target side, and study the effect of the combination of segmentation with reordering.</S>
          <S ID="S-18257">As mentioned in Section 2.1, simple pattern matching is not enough to decompose Arabic words into stems and affixes.</S>
          <S ID="S-18258">Lexical information and context are needed to perform the decomposition correctly.</S>
          <S ID="S-18259">We use the Morphological Analyzer MADA (<REF ID="R-16" RPTR="25">Habash and Rambow, 2005</REF>) to decompose the Arabic source.</S>
          <S ID="S-18260">MADA uses SVMbased classifiers of features (such as POS, number, gender, etc.) to score the different analyses of a given word in context.</S>
          <S ID="S-18261">We apply morphological decomposition before aligning the training data.</S>
          <S ID="S-18262">We split the conjunction and preposition prefixes, as well as possessive and object pronoun suffixes.</S>
          <S ID="S-18263">We then glue the split morphemes into one prefix and one suffix, such that any given word is split into at most three parts: prefix+ stem +suffix.</S>
          <S ID="S-18264">Note that plural markers and subject pronouns are not split.</S>
          <S ID="S-18265">For example, the word wlAwlAdh (&#8217;and for his children&#8217;) is segmented into wl+ AwlAd +P:3MS.</S>

        <P>

        <P>
          <S ID="S-18277">This section presents the syntax-based rules used for re-ordering the English source to better match the syntax of the Arabic target.</S>
          <S ID="S-18278">These rules are motivated by the Arabic syntactic facts described in Section 2.2.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-18279">Much like <REF ID="R-12" RPTR="17">Wang et al. (2007)</REF>, we parse the English side of our corpora and reorder using predefined rules.</S>
          <S ID="S-18280">Reordering the English can be done more reliably than other source languages, such as Arabic, Chinese and German, since the stateof-the-art English parsers are considerably better than parsers of other languages.</S>
          <S ID="S-18281">The following rules for reordering at the sentence level and the noun phrase level are applied to the English parse tree:</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-18282">1.</S>
          <S ID="S-18283">NP: All nouns, adjectives and adverbs in the noun phrase are inverted.</S>
          <S ID="S-18284">This rule is motivated by the order of the adjective with respect to its head noun, as well as the idafa construct (see Examples 6 and 7 in Section 2.2.</S>
          <S ID="S-18285">As a result of applying this rule, the phrase the blank computer screen becomes the screen computer blank .</S>

          <S ID="S-18288">All N i are also made indefinite, and the definite article is added to N n , the last noun in the chain.</S>
          <S ID="S-18289">For example, the phrase the general chief of staff of the armed forces becomes general chief staff the armed forces.</S>
          <S ID="S-18290">We also move all adjectives in the top noun phrase to the end of the construct.</S>
          <S ID="S-18291">So the real value of the Egyptian pound becomes value the Egyptian pound real.</S>
          <S ID="S-18292">This rule is motivated by the idafa construct and its properties (see Example 6).</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-18293">3. the: The definite article the is replicated before adjectives (see Example 5 above).</S>
          <S ID="S-18294">So the blank computer screen becomes the blank the computer the screen.</S>
          <S ID="S-18295">This rule is applied after NP rule abote.</S>
          <S ID="S-18296">Note that we do not replicate the before proper names.</S>

          <S ID="S-18298">VP: This rule transforms SVO sentences to VSO.</S>
          <S ID="S-18299">All verbs are reordered on the condition that they have their own subject noun phrase and are not in the participle form, since in these cases the Arabic subject occurs before the verb participle.</S>
          <S ID="S-18300">We also check that the verb is not in a relative clause with a that complementizer (Example 3 above).</S>
          <S ID="S-18301">The following example illustrates all these cases: the health minister stated that 11 police officers were wounded in clashes with the demonstrators &#8594; stated the health minister that 11 police officers were wounded in clashes with the demonstrators.</S>
          <S ID="S-18302">If the verb is negated, the negative particle is moved with the verb (Example 4.</S>
          <S ID="S-18303">Finally, if the object of the reordered verb is a pronoun, it is reordered with the verb.</S>
          <S ID="S-18304">Example: the authorities gave us all the necessary help becomes gave us the authorities all the necessary help.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-18305">The transformation rules 1, 2 and 3 are applied in this order, since they interact although they do not conflict.</S>

          <S ID="S-18321">It is important to note that the sentences in the travel domain are much shorter than in the news domain, which simplifies the alignment as well as reordering during decoding.</S>
          <S ID="S-18322">Also, since the travel domain contains spoken Arabic, it is more biased towards the Subject-Verb-Object sentence order than the Verb-Subject-Object order more common in the news domain.</S>
          <S ID="S-18323">Also note that since most of our data was originally intended for Arabic-to-English translation, our test and tuning sets have only one reference, and therefore, the BLEU scores we report are lower than typical scores reported in the literature on Arabic-to- English.</S>

          <S ID="S-18353">Replicating the before adjectives hurts the scores, possibly because it increases the sentence length noticeably, and thus deteriorates the alignments&#8217; quality.</S>
          <S ID="S-18354">We note that the gains achieved by reordering on the NIST test set are smaller than the improvements on the random test set.</S>
          <S ID="S-18355">This is due to the fact that the sentences in the NIST test set are longer, which adversely affects the parsing quality.</S>
          <S ID="S-18356">The average English sentence length is 33 words in the NIST test set, while the random test set has an average sentence length of 29 words.</S>

          <S ID="S-18364">In Table 4, we report results on the UN corpus for different training data sizes.</S>
          <S ID="S-18365">It is important to note that although gains from VP reordering stay constant when scaled to larger training sets, gains from NP+PP reordering diminish.</S>
          <S ID="S-18366">This is due to the fact that NP reordering tend to be more localized then VP reorderings.</S>
          <S ID="S-18367">Hence with more training data the lexicalized reordering model becomes more effective in reordering NPs.</S>

          <S ID="S-18370">Hence, the gain introduced by reordering might not be enough to offset the errors introduced by the parsing.</S>
          <S ID="S-18371">We also note that spoken Arabic usually prefers the Subject- Verb-Object sentence order, rather than the Verb- Subject-Object sentence order of written Arabic.</S>
          <S ID="S-18372">This explains the fact that no gain is observed when the verb phrase is reordered.</S>
          <S ID="S-18373">Noun phrase reordering produces a significant gain with nonsegmented Arabic.</S>
          <S ID="S-18374">Replicating the definite article the in the noun phrase does not create alignment problems as is the case with the newswire data, since the sentences are considerably shorter, and hence the 0.74 point gain observed on the segmented Arabic system.</S>
          <S ID="S-18375">That gain does not translate to the non-segmented Arabic system since in that case the definite article Al remains attached to its head word.</S>
