      <P>
        <S ID="S-42636">In this paper we describe an ongoing work concerning the studies in gathering and using Common Sense knowledge and building Machine Translation applications.</S>
        <S ID="S-42637">Common Sense (CS) can be defined as the knowledge shared by a group of people in a given time, space and culture.</S>
        <S ID="S-42638">1 Machine Translation (MT), in turn, is the application of computer programs to generate a translated equivalent version of a source text, in a target language.</S>

        <S ID="S-42641">MT is one of the oldest and most important areas of Natural Language Processing (NLP) / Computational Linguistics (CL).</S>
        <S ID="S-42642">2 From its beginnings we have witnessed some changes in the proposed MT paradigms ranging from the basic level &#8212;in which MT is performed by just replacing words in a source language by words in a target language&#8212; to more sophisticated ones &#8212;which rely on manually created translation rules (Rule-based Machine Translation) or automatically generated statistical models (Statistical Machine Translation, SMT).</S>
        <S ID="S-42643">Nowadays, the majority of the researches has being centered around the phrase-based statistical MT (PB-SMT) approach &#8212;such as (<REF ID="R-16" RPTR="11">Koehn et al., 2003</REF>) and (<REF ID="R-23" RPTR="17">Och and Ney, 2004</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-42644">PB-SMT is considered the state-of-the-art according to the automatic evaluation measures BLEU (<REF ID="R-24" RPTR="18">Papineni et al., 2002</REF>) and NIST (<REF ID="R-13" RPTR="8">Doddington, 2002</REF>) 3 .</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-42645">Although PB-SMT models have achieved the state-of-the-art translation quality, there are strong evidences that these models will not be able to go further without more linguistically motivated features, as stated by <REF ID="R-28" RPTR="21">Tinsley and Way (2009)</REF>.</S>
        <S ID="S-42646">This is already being illustrated by the recent shift of researches towards linguistically enriched models as (<REF ID="R-15" RPTR="9">Koehn and Hoang, 2007</REF>) and (<REF ID="R-28" RPTR="22">Tinsley and Way, 2009</REF>) among others.</S>

        <S ID="S-42649">interchangeably since this is the assumption adopted in Brazil.</S>

      <P>
        <S ID="S-42652">how it is possible to improve MT performance based on more linguistically motivated features.</S>
        <S ID="S-42653">In our case, we intend to investigate how to apply Common Sense knowledge to generate more culturally contextualized automatic translations.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-42654">For example, considering the translation of slangs 4 as in the English sentence &#8220;Jump, you chicken!&#8221; 5 .</S>
        <S ID="S-42655">In this case, the word &#8220;chicken&#8221; do not mean &#8220;a kind of bird&#8221; but &#8220;a coward&#8221; or &#8220;a person who is not brave&#8221;.</S>
        <S ID="S-42656">However, its translation to Portuguese (&#8220;galinha&#8221;) can also be applied as a slang with a completely different meaning.</S>
        <S ID="S-42657">In the Portuguese language, the slang &#8220;galinha&#8221; means a men with a lot of girlfriends.</S>
        <S ID="S-42658">Although the problem stated in the given example could also be fixed by some dictionary entries, CS knowledge is the kind of information that varies a lot and frequently can not be found in traditional dictionaries.</S>
        <S ID="S-42659">Thus, we believe that the CS knowledge derived from the OMCS projects is an alternative way to cope with these translation problems.</S>

      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-42672">The SMT was born in the late 1980s as an effort of researchers from IBM (Brown et al., 1990).</S>
        <S ID="S-42673">In those days, SMT was performed based on two models: a word-based translation model and a language model.</S>
        <S ID="S-42674">While the first model is concerned with the production of target equivalent versions of the source sentences, the second one guarantees that the output sentence is a possible one (it is grammatical and fluent) in the target language.</S>
        <S ID="S-42675">In the current PB- SMT systems, the word-based models were replaced by the phrase-based ones built based on sequences of words (the phrases).</S>
        <S ID="S-42676">9</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-42677">The translation and language models used in SMT are built from a training parallel corpora (a set of source sentences and their translations into the target language) by means of IBM models (Brown et al., 1993) which calculate the probability of a given source word (or sequences of words) be translated to a target word (or sequence of words).</S>
        <S ID="S-42678">The availability of some open-source toolkits (such as Moses (<REF ID="R-17" RPTR="12">Koehn et al., 2007</REF>) 10 ) to train, test and evaluate SMT models has helping the widely employment of this MT approach to perhaps almost any language pair and corpus type.</S>
        <S ID="S-42679">In fact, SMT is an inexpensive, easy and language independent way for detecting recurrent phrases that form the language and translation models.</S>
        <S ID="S-42680">However, while PB-SMT models have achieved the state-of-the-art translation quality, its performance seams to be stagnated.</S>
        <S ID="S-42681">Consequently, there is a recent common trend towards enriching the current models with some extra knowledge as the new approaches of factored translation models (<REF ID="R-15" RPTR="10">Koehn and Hoang, 2007</REF>) or syntax-based (or syntaxaugmented) MT systems (<REF ID="R-27" RPTR="20">Tiedemann and Kotz&#233;, 2009</REF>; <REF ID="R-28" RPTR="23">Tinsley and Way, 2009</REF>; Zollmann et al., 2008).</S>

        <S ID="S-42688">Since they are interactive tools, the phrases are first displayed on the screen in the end-user&#8217;s native language and, then, he/she selects a phrase to be translated (by a text-to-speech engine) in the language in which the conversation is taking place.</S>

        <S ID="S-42689">In our work, the main goal is also investigating new ways to improve MT performance, but instead of greater BLEU or NIST values we are interested in producing more culturally contextualized translations.</S>

        <S ID="S-42723">To do so, we are working with two ConceptNets derived from OMCS and OMCS-Br projects, that represent the CS knowledge in English and Brazilian Portuguese, respectively, as presented in section 3.</S>

        <S ID="S-42747">Supposing that our SMTT is not able to provide a translation for the words &#8220;dude&#8221; and &#8220;C-note&#8221; &#8212;what is, indeed, a true possibility&#8212; outputting an incomplete translation in which these words remain untranslated.</S>
        <S ID="S-42748">Consequently, the Brazilian user would not understand the American&#8217;s sentence incompletely translated to Portuguese.</S>
        <S ID="S-42749">So, since the SMTT do not know the translation of these slangs, the CSKT will be started to look for possible definitions in the CS knowledge bases.</S>
        <S ID="S-42750">At this moment, the CSKT could provide some basic information about the untranslated words, for example that &#8220;dude is a slang&#8221; and &#8220;dude (is) defined as guy&#8221; or that &#8220;C-note (is) defined as 100 dollars&#8221;, etc. Being aware of the untranslated words and their cultural meanings displayed by the CSKT, the American user could change or edit his/her original message by writing:</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-42751">American says: &#8220;Hey guy, I will borrow 100 dollars from someone tomorrow!&#8221;.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-42752">The final edited sentence has a higher probability to occur in the target language than the original one and, so, to be corrected translated by the SMTT.</S>
        <S ID="S-42753">In addition to this master&#8217;s project, we are also developing two undergraduate researches aiming at discovering useful knowledge from the &#8220;parallel&#8221; ConceptNets.</S>
        <S ID="S-42754">The first ongoing undergraduate research (<REF ID="R-06" RPTR="3">Barchi et al., 2009</REF>) aims at aligning the parallel concepts found in Brazilian and English ConceptNets.</S>
        <S ID="S-42755">This alignment can be performed, for example, based on lexical alignments automatically generated by GIZA++ 21 (<REF ID="R-22" RPTR="16">Och and Ney, 2000</REF>) or the hierarchical structure of the nodes and arcs in the ConceptNets.</S>
        <S ID="S-42756">The second ongoing undergraduate research (<REF ID="R-19" RPTR="13">Meuchi et al., 2009</REF>), in turn, is involved with the enrichment of one ConceptNet based on the relations found in the other (parallel) ConceptNet and also in lexically aligned parallel texts.</S>

      <HEADER>5 Opportunities for Collaboration</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-42757">The work described in this paper presents the first steps towards applying semantic knowledge to generate more culturally contextualized translations between Brazilian Portuguese and English texts.</S>
        <S ID="S-42758">In this sense, we see some opportunities for collaboration regarding the roles that are played by: (1) our research work, (2) the semantic resources available to be used and (3) the resources and results that will be produced by our work.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-42759">First of all, this work is a joint effort of two research areas: NLP/CL (machine translation) and human-computer interaction (HCI) (common sense knowledge gathering and usage).</S>
        <S ID="S-42760">From this fact, we see a great opportunity to bring a new &#8220;vision&#8221; to the NLP/CL applications in which we are concerned with not only to produce a correct answer to the proposed problem, but also an answer that sounds more natural and user-friendly.</S>
        <S ID="S-42761">So, regarding our work&#8217;s role, we see the opportunity to improve the collaboration between researchers from NLP/CL and HCI.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-42762">The second possibility of collaboration envisioned by us is related to other sources of semantic knowledge that could be applied to our work.</S>
        <S ID="S-42763">Although we are using common sense knowledge to support the generation of more culturally contextualized translations, other semantic information bases could also be applied.</S>
        <S ID="S-42764">In this case, we believe that this workshop is a great opportunity to be aware of other research projects that apply semantic knowledge to MT or are engaged with the construction of semantic resources that could be used in our work.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-42765">Finally, we also see a future source of collaboration regarding the use of the bilingual resources obtained as the product of this research.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-42766">21 http://code.google.com/p/giza-pp/</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-42767">The parallel-aligned (in Brazilian Portuguese and English) common sense base, the translation knowledge inferred from this aligned base or even the bilingual culturally contextualized chat would be useful in other research projects in MT or other bilingual applications such as information retrieval or summarization.</S>
        <S ID="S-42768">We also believe that the methodology applied to develop these resources and the results obtained from this work could be applied to other language pairs to derive new bilingual similar resources.</S>

      <HEADER>6 Conclusions and Future Work</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-42769">In this paper we have described the first ideas and steps towards the culturally contextualized machine translation, a new approach to generate automatic translations using a phrase-based SMT tool and a common sense knowledge tool.</S>
        <S ID="S-42770">It is important to say that this proposal involves researchers from NLP/CL an HCI and it brings an opportunity for collaboration between these related areas.</S>
        <S ID="S-42771">Furthermore, this work aims at stimulating researchers from other countries to work with the Brazilian Portuguese and presenting its ideas in this workshop is a great opportunity to achieve this goal.</S>
        <S ID="S-42772">Future steps of this ongoing work are concerned with the implementation of the proposed prototypes designed for the bilingual culturally contextualized chat, the alignment and the enrichment of the ConceptNets.</S>
        <S ID="S-42773">After the implementation of these prototypes they will be tested and refined to encompass the needed improvements.</S>
