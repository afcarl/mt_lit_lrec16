      <HEADER>1 Introduction</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-7287">In this work, we augment the translation model for a low-resource phrase-based SMT system by automatically expanding its phrase table.</S>
        <S ID="S-7288">We &#8220;hallucinate&#8221; new phrase table entries by composing the unigram translations from the baseline system&#8217;s phrase table and translations learned from comparable monolingual corpora.</S>
        <S ID="S-7289">The composition process yields a very large number of new phrase pair translations, which are high recall but low precision.</S>
        <S ID="S-7290">We filter the phrase table using a new set of feature functions estimated from monolingual corpora.</S>
        <S ID="S-7291">We evaluate the hallucinated phrase pairs intrinsically as well as in end-to-end machine translation.</S>
        <S ID="S-7292">The augmented phrase table provides more coverage than the original phrase table, while being high quality enough to improve translation performance.</S>

      <HEADER>2 Motivation</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-7305">Translation models learned over small amounts of parallel data suffer from the problem of low coverage.</S>
        <S ID="S-7306">That is, they do not include translations for many words and phrases.</S>
        <S ID="S-7307">Unknown</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-7308">words, or out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, have been the focus of previous work on integrating bilingual lexicon induction and machine translation (<REF ID="R-03" RPTR="3">Daum&#233; and Jagarlamudi, 2011</REF>; <REF ID="R-10" RPTR="13">Irvine and Callison-Burch, 2013</REF><REF ID="R-11" RPTR="16">Irvine and Callison-Burch, 2013</REF>a; <REF ID="R-26" RPTR="38">Razmara et al., 2013</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-7309">Bilingual lexicon induction is the task of learning translations from monolingual texts, and typical approaches compare projected distributional signatures of words in the source language with distributional signatures representing target language words (<REF ID="R-23" RPTR="33">Rapp, 1995</REF>; <REF ID="R-27" RPTR="39">Schafer and Yarowsky, 2002</REF>; <REF ID="R-14" RPTR="22">Koehn and Knight, 2002</REF>; <REF ID="R-08" RPTR="10">Haghighi et al., 2008</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-7310">If the source and target language each contain, for example, 100, 000 words, the number of pairwise comparisons is about 10 billion, which is significant but computationally feasible.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-7311">In contrast to unigrams, the difficulty in inducing a comprehensive set of phrase translations is that the number of both source and target phrases is immense.</S>
        <S ID="S-7312">For example, there are about 83 million unique phrases up to length three in the English Wikipedia.</S>
        <S ID="S-7313">Pairwise comparisons of two sets of 100 million phrases corresponds to 1 x 10 16 .</S>
        <S ID="S-7314">Thus, even if we limit the task to short phrases, the number of pairwise phrase comparisons necessary to do an exhaustive search is infeasible.</S>
        <S ID="S-7315">However, multi-word translation units have been shown to improve the quality of SMT dramatically (<REF ID="R-15" RPTR="23">Koehn et al., 2003</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-7316">Phrase translations allow translation models to memorize local context-dependent translations and reordering patterns.</S>
      </P>

      <HEADER>3 Approach</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-7381">Rather than compare all source language phrases with all target language phrases, our approach efficiently proposes a smaller set of hypothesis phrase translations for each source language phrase.</S>
        <S ID="S-7382">Our method builds upon the notion that many phrase translations can be composed from the translations of its component words and subphrases.</S>
        <S ID="S-7383">For example Spanish la bruja verde translates into English as the green witch.</S>
        <S ID="S-7384">Each Spanish word corresponds to exactly one English word.</S>
        <S ID="S-7385">The phrase pair could be memorized and translated as a unit, or the English translation could be composed from the translations of each Spanish unigram.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-7386"><REF ID="R-29" RPTR="41">Zens et al. (2012)</REF> found that only 2% of phrase pairs in German-English, Czech-English, Spanish- English, and French-English phrase tables consist of multi-word source and target phrases and are non-compositional.</S>
        <S ID="S-7387">That is, for these languages, the vast majority of phrase pairs in a given phrase table could be composed from smaller units.</S>
        <S ID="S-7388">Our approach takes advantage of the fact that many phrases can be translated compositionally.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-7389">We describe our approach in three parts.</S>
        <S ID="S-7390">In Section 3.1, we begin by inducing translations for unknown unigrams.</S>
        <S ID="S-7391">Then, in 3.2, we introduce our algorithm for composing phrase translations.</S>
        <S ID="S-7392">In order to achieve a high recall in our set of hypothesis translations, we define compositionality more loosely than is typical.</S>
        <S ID="S-7393">Finally, in 3.3, we use comparable corpora to prune the large set of hypothesis translations for each source phrase.</S>

        <HEADER>3.1 Unigram Translations</HEADER>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-7317">In any low resource setting, many word translations are likely to be unknown.</S>
          <S ID="S-7318">Therefore, before moving to phrases, we use a bilingual lexicon induction technique to identify translations for unigrams.</S>
          <S ID="S-7319">Specifically, because we assume a setting where we have some small amount of parallel data, we follow our prior work on supervised bilingual lexicon induction (Irvine and Callison- Burch, 2013b).</S>
          <S ID="S-7320">We take examples of good translation pairs from our word aligned training data (described in Section 4) and use random word pairs as negative supervision.</S>
          <S ID="S-7321">We use this supervision to learn a log-linear classifier that predicts whether a given word pair is a translation or not.</S>
          <S ID="S-7322">We pair and score all source language unigrams in our tuning and test sets with target language unigrams that appear in our comparable corpora.</S>
          <S ID="S-7323">Then, for each source language unigram, we use the log-linear model scores to rerank candidate target language unigram translations.</S>
          <S ID="S-7324">As in our prior work, we include the following word pair features in our log-linear classifier: contextual similarity, temporal similarity, topic similarity, frequency similarity, and orthographic similarity.</S>

        <HEADER>3.2 Loosely Compositional Translations</HEADER>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-7325">We propose a novel technique for loosely composing phrasal translations from an existing dictionary of unigram translations and stop word lists.</S>
          <S ID="S-7326">Given a source language phrase, our approach considers all combinations and all permutations of all unigram translations for each source phrase content word.</S>

      <P>
        <S ID="S-7451">Before moving to the results of our proposed approach for composing phrase translations, we present an oracle experiment to answer these research questions: Would a low resource translation model benefit from composing its unigram translations into phrases?</S>
        <S ID="S-7452">Would this be further improved by adding unigram translations that are learned from monolingual texts?</S>
        <S ID="S-7453">We answer these questions by starting with our lowresource Spanish-English and Hindi-English baselines and augmenting each with (1) phrasal translations composed from baseline model unigram translations, and (2) phrasal translations composed of a mix of baseline model unigram translations and the monolingually-induced unigrams.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-7454">Figure 2 illustrates how our hallucinated phrasetable entries can result in improved translation quality for Spanish to English translation.</S>
        <S ID="S-7455">Since the baseline model is trained from such a small amount of data, it typically translates individual words instead of phrases.</S>
        <S ID="S-7456">In our augmented system, we compose a translation of was no one from habia nadie, since habia translates as was in the baseline model, nadie translates as one, and no is a stop word.</S>

        <S ID="S-7458">In our oracle experiments, composed translations are only added to the phrase table if they are contained in the reference.</S>
        <S ID="S-7459">This eliminates the huge number of noisy translations that our compositional algorithm generates.</S>
        <S ID="S-7460">We augment baseline models with translations for the same sets of source language phrases described in Section 4.</S>

      <P>
        <S ID="S-7583">Our results showed that including a high recall set of &#8220;hallucinated&#8221; translations in our augmented phrase table successfully improved the quality of our machine translations.</S>
        <S ID="S-7584">The algorithm that we proposed for hypothesizing translations is flexible, and in future work we plan to modify it slightly to output even more candidate translations.</S>
        <S ID="S-7585">For example, we could retrieve target phrases which contain at least one source word translation instead of all.</S>
        <S ID="S-7586">Alternatively, we could identify candidates using entirely different information, for example the monolingual frequency of a source and target word, instead of unigram translations.</S>
        <S ID="S-7587">This type of inverted index may improve recall in the set of hypothesis phrase translations at the cost of generating a much bigger set for reranking.</S>
        <S ID="S-7588">Our new phrase table features were informative in distinguishing correct from incorrect phrase translations, and they allowed us to make use of noisy but high recall supplemental phrase pairs.</S>
        <S ID="S-7589">This is a critical result for research on identifying phrase translations from non-parallel text.</S>
        <S ID="S-7590">We also believe that using fairly strong target (English) language models contributed to our models&#8217; ability to discriminate between good and bad hallucinated phrase pairs.</S>
        <S ID="S-7591">We leave research on the influence of the language model in our setting to future work.</S>
        <S ID="S-7592">In this work, we experimented with two language pairs, Spanish-English and Hindi-English.</S>
        <S ID="S-7593">While Spanish and English are very closely related, Hindi and English are less related.</S>
        <S ID="S-7594">Our oracle experiments showed potential for composing phrase translations for both language pairs, and, indeed, in our experiments using hallucinated phrase translations we saw significant translation quality gains for both.</S>
        <S ID="S-7595">We expect that improving the quality of induced unigram translations will yield even more performance gains.</S>

      <P>
        <S ID="S-7596">The vast majority of prior work on low resource MT has focused on Spanish-English (<REF ID="R-08" RPTR="11">Haghighi et al., 2008</REF>; <REF ID="R-13" RPTR="21">Klementiev et al., 2012</REF>; <REF ID="R-24" RPTR="34">Ravi and Knight, 2011</REF>; <REF ID="R-05" RPTR="6">Dou and Knight, 2012</REF>; <REF ID="R-25" RPTR="36">Ravi, 2013</REF>; <REF ID="R-06" RPTR="8">Dou and Knight, 2013</REF>).</S>

        <S ID="S-7599">The success of our approach that we have seen for Spanish and Hindi suggests that it is worth pursuing such directions for other even less related and resourced language pairs.</S>
        <S ID="S-7600">In addition to language pair, text genre and the degree of looseness or literalness of given parallel corpora may also affect the amount of phrase translation compositionality.</S>

        <S ID="S-7601">Phrase-based SMT models estimated over very large parallel corpora are expensive to store and process.</S>
        <S ID="S-7602">Prior work has reduced the size of SMT phrase tables in order to improve efficiency without the loss of translation quality (<REF ID="R-09" RPTR="12">He et al., 2009</REF>; <REF ID="R-12" RPTR="19">Johnson et al., 2007</REF>; <REF ID="R-29" RPTR="42">Zens et al., 2012</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-7603">Typically, the goal of pruning is to identify and remove phrase pairs which are likely to be inaccurate, using either the scores and counts of a given pair itself or those relative to other phrase pairs.</S>
        <S ID="S-7604">Our work, in contrast, focuses on low resource settings, where training data is limited and provides incomplete and unreliable scored phrase pairs.</S>
        <S ID="S-7605">We begin by dramatically increasing the size of our SMT phrase table in order to expand its coverage and then use non-parallel data to rescore and filter the table.</S>
        <S ID="S-7606">In the decipherment task, translation models are learned from comparable corpora without any parallel text (<REF ID="R-24" RPTR="35">Ravi and Knight, 2011</REF>; <REF ID="R-05" RPTR="7">Dou and Knight, 2012</REF>; <REF ID="R-25" RPTR="37">Ravi, 2013</REF>).</S>

        <S ID="S-7611">That work uses two dictionaries to bootstrap a set of phrase pair translations: one probabilistic dictionary extracted from 2 million words of bitext and one manually created new-domain dictionary of 140, 000 word translations.</S>
