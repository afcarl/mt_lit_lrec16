  <TITLE>Integrating N-best SMT Outputs into a TM System</TITLE>

  <ABSTRACT>
    <A-S ID="S-2740">In this paper, we propose a novel framework to enrich Translation Memory (TM) systems with Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) outputs using ranking.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-2741">In order to offer the human translators multiple choices, instead of only using the top SMT output and top TM hit, we merge the N-best output from the SMT system and the k-best hits with highest fuzzy match scores from the TM system.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-2742">The merged list is then ranked according to the prospective post-editing effort and provided to the translators to aid their work.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-2743">Experiments show that our ranked output achieve 0.8747 precision at top 1 and 0.8134 precision at top 5.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-2744">Our framework facilitates a tight integration between SMT and TM, where full advantage is taken of TM while high quality SMT output is availed of to improve the productivity of human translators.</A-S>

      <HEADER>1 Introduction</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-2745">Translation Memories (TM) are databases that store translated segments.</S>
        <S ID="S-2746">They are often used to assist translators and post-editors in a Computer Assisted Translation (CAT) environment by returning the most similar translated segments.</S>
        <S ID="S-2747">Professional post-editors and translators have long been relying on TMs to avoid duplication of work in translation.</S>
        <S ID="S-2748">With the rapid development in statistical machine translation (SMT), MT systems are beginning to generate acceptable translations, especially in domains where abundant parallel corpora exist.</S>
        <S ID="S-2749">It is thus natural to ask if these translations can be utilized in some way to enhance TMs.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-2750">However advances in MT are being adopted only slowly and sometimes somewhat reluctantly in professional localization and post-editing environments because of 1) the usefulness of the TM, 2) the investment and effort the company has put into TMs, and 3) the lack of robust SMT confidence estimation measures which are as reliable as fuzzy match scores (cf. Section 4.1.2) used in TMs.</S>
        <S ID="S-2751">Currently the localization industry relies on TM fuzzy match scores to obtain both a good approximation of post-editing effort and an estimation of the overall translation cost.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-2752">In a forthcoming paper, we propose a translation recommendation model to better integrate MT outputs into a TM system.</S>
        <S ID="S-2753">Using a binary classifier, we only recommend an MT output to the TM-user when the classifier is highly confident that it is better than the TM output.</S>
        <S ID="S-2754">In this framework, post-editors continue to work with the TM while benefiting from (better) SMT outputs; the assets in TMs are not wasted and TM fuzzy match scores can still be used to estimate (the upper bound of) post-editing labor.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-2755">In the previous work, the binary predictor works on the 1-best output of the MT and TM systems, presenting either the one or the other to the post-editor.</S>
        <S ID="S-2756">In this paper, we develop the idea further by moving from binary prediction to ranking.</S>
        <S ID="S-2757">We use a ranking model to merge the k-best lists of the two systems, and produce a ranked merged</S>

        <S ID="S-2759">list for post-editing.</S>
        <S ID="S-2760">As the list is an enriched version of the TM&#8217;s k-best list, the TM related assets are better preserved and the cost estimation is still valid as an upper bound.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-2761">More specifically, we recast SMT-TM integration as a ranking problem, where we apply the Ranking SVM technique to produce a ranked list of translations combining the k-best lists of both the MT and the TM systems.</S>
        <S ID="S-2762">We use features independent of the MT and TM systems for ranking, so that outputs from MT and TM can have the same set of features.</S>
        <S ID="S-2763">Ideally the translations should be ranked by their associated postediting efforts, but given the very limited amounts of human annotated data, we use an automatic MT evaluation metric, TER (<REF ID="R-15" RPTR="16">Snover et al., 2006</REF>), which is specifically designed to simulate postediting effort to train and test our ranking model.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-2764">The rest of the paper is organized as follows: we first briefly introduce related research in Section 2, and review Ranking SVMs in Section 3.</S>
        <S ID="S-2765">The formulation of the problem and experiments with the ranking models are presented in Sections 4 and 5.</S>
        <S ID="S-2766">We analyze the post-editing effort approximated by the TER metric in Section 6.</S>
        <S ID="S-2767">Section 7 concludes and points out avenues for future research.</S>

      <P>
        <S ID="S-2768">There has been some work to help TM users to apply MT outputs more smoothly.</S>
        <S ID="S-2769">One strand is to improve the MT confidence measures to better predict post-editing effort in order to obtain a quality estimation that has the potential to replace the fuzzy match score in the TM.</S>
        <S ID="S-2770">To the best of our knowledge, the first paper in this area is (<REF ID="R-07" RPTR="6">Specia et al., 2009</REF><REF ID="R-08" RPTR="8">Specia et al., 2009</REF>a), which uses regression on both the automatic scores and scores assigned by posteditors.</S>
        <S ID="S-2771">The method is improved in (<REF ID="R-07" RPTR="7">Specia et al., 2009</REF><REF ID="R-08" RPTR="9">Specia et al., 2009</REF>b), which applies Inductive Confidence Machines and a larger set of features to model post-editors&#8217; judgment of the translation quality between &#8216;good&#8217; and &#8216;bad&#8217;, or among three levels of post-editing effort.</S>
        <S ID="S-2772">Another strand is to integrate high confidence MT outputs into the TM, so that the &#8216;good&#8217; TM entries will remain untouched.</S>
        <S ID="S-2773">In our forthcoming paper, we recommend SMT outputs to a TM user when a binary classifier predicts that SMT outputs are more suitable for post-editing for a particular sentence.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-2774">The research presented here continues the line of research in the second strand.</S>
        <S ID="S-2775">The difference is that we do not limit ourselves to the 1-best output but try to produce a k-best output in a ranking model.</S>
        <S ID="S-2776">The ranking scheme also enables us to show all TM hits to the user, and thus further protects the TM assets.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-2777">There has also been work to improve SMT using the knowledge from the TM.</S>
        <S ID="S-2778">In (<REF ID="R-14" RPTR="15">Simard and Isabelle, 2009</REF>), the SMT system can produce a better translation when there is an exact or close match in the corresponding TM.</S>
        <S ID="S-2779">They use regression Support Vector Machines to model the quality of the TM segments.</S>
        <S ID="S-2780">This is also related to our work in spirit, but our work is in the opposite direction, i.e. using SMT to enrich TM.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-2781">Moreover, our ranking model is related to reranking (<REF ID="R-12" RPTR="13">Shen et al., 2004</REF>) in SMT as well.</S>
        <S ID="S-2782">However, our method does not focus on producing better 1-best translation output for an SMT system, but on improving the overall quality of the k-best list that TM systems present to post-editors.</S>
        <S ID="S-2783">Some features in our work are also different in nature to those used in MT reranking.</S>
        <S ID="S-2784">For instance we cannot use N-best posterior scores as they do not make sense for the TM outputs.</S>

          <S ID="S-2912">The ranking receives 0.8747 PREC@1, which means that most of the top ranked translations have at least the same quality as the top TM output.</S>
          <S ID="S-2913">We notice that precision remains above 0.8 till k = 5, leading us to conclude that most of the relevant translations are ranked in the top-5 positions in the list.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-2914">Using the HIT@k scores we can further confirm this argument.</S>
          <S ID="S-2915">The HIT@k score grows steadily from 0.8747 to 0.9941 for k = 1...6, so most often there will be at least one relevant translation in top-6 for the post-editor to work with.</S>
          <S ID="S-2916">After that room for improvement becomes very small.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-2917">In sum, both of the PREC@k scores and the HIT@k scores show that the ranking model effectively integrates the two translation sources (MT and TM) into one merged k-best list, and ranks the relevant translations higher.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-2918">To measure whether the ranking model is effective compared to pure MT or TM outputs, we report the PREC@k of those outputs in Table 2.</S>
          <S ID="S-2919">The k-best output used in this table is ranked by the MT or TM system, without being ranked by our model.</S>

      <HEADER>6 Analysis of Post-Editing Effort</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-2960">A natural question follows the PREC and HIT numbers: after reading the ranked k-best list, will the post-editors edit less than they would have to if they did not have access to the list?</S>
        <S ID="S-2961">This question would be best answered by human post-editors in a large-scale experimental setting.</S>
        <S ID="S-2962">As we have not yet conducted a manual post-editing experiment, we try to measure the post-editing effort implied by our model with the edit statistics captured by the TER metric, sorted into four types: Insertion, Substitution, Deletion and Shift.</S>
        <S ID="S-2963">We report the average number of edits incurred along with the 0.95 confidence interval.</S>

        <HEADER>6.1 Top-1 Edit Statistics</HEADER>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-2926">We report the results on the 1-best output of TM, MT and our ranking system in Table 3.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-2927">In the single best results, it is easy to see that the 1-best output from the MT system requires the least post-editing effort.</S>
          <S ID="S-2928">This is not surprising given the distribution of the gold standard in Section 5.3, where most MT outputs are of better quality than the TM hits.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-2929">Moreover, since TM translations are generally of much lower quality as is indicated by the numbers in Table 3 (e.g. 2x as many substitutions and 3x as many deletions compared to MT), unjustly including very few of them in the ranking output will increase loss in the edit statistics.</S>
          <S ID="S-2930">This explains why the ranking model has better ranking precision in Tables 1 and 2, but seems to incur more edit efforts.</S>
          <S ID="S-2931">However, in practice posteditors can neglect an obvious &#8216;bad&#8217; translation very quickly.</S>

          <S ID="S-2933">For each system we report two sets of statistics: the Beststatistics calculated on the best output (according</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-2934">to TER score) in the list, and the Mean- statistics calculated on the whole Top-k list.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-2935">The Mean- numbers allow us to have a general overview of the ranking quality, but it is strongly influenced by the poor TM hits that can easily be neglected in practice.</S>
          <S ID="S-2936">To control the impact of those TM hits, we rely on the Best- numbers to estimate the edits performed on the translations that are more likely to be used by post-editors.</S>
          <S ID="S-2937">In Table 4, the ranking output&#8217;s edit statistics is closer to the MT output than the Top-1 case in Table 3.</S>
          <S ID="S-2938">Table 5 continues this tendency, in which the Best-in-Top5 Ranking output requires marginally less Substitution and Deletion operations and significantly less Insertion and Shift operations (starred) than its MT counterpart.</S>
          <S ID="S-2939">This shows that when more of the list is explored, the advantage of the ranking model &#8211; utilizing multiple translation sources &#8211; begins to compensate for the possible large number of edits required by poor TM hits and finally leads to reduced postediting effort.</S>
          <S ID="S-2940">There are several explanations to why the relative performance of the ranking model improves when k increases, as compared to other models.</S>
          <S ID="S-2941">The most obvious explanation is that a single poor translation is less likely to hurt edit statistics on a k-best list with large k, if most of the translations in the k-best list are of good quality.</S>
          <S ID="S-2942">We see from Tables 1 and 2 that the ranking output is of better quality than the MT and TM outputs w.r.t.</S>
          <S ID="S-2943">precision.</S>
          <S ID="S-2944">For a larger k, the small number of incorrectly ranked translations are less likely to be chosen as the Best- translation and hold back the Best- numbers.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-2945">A further reason is related to our ranking model which optimizes on Kendall&#8217;s &#964; score.</S>
          <S ID="S-2946">Accordingly the output might not be optimal when we evaluate the Top-1 output, but will behave better when we evaluate on the list.</S>
          <S ID="S-2947">This is also in accordance with our aim, which is to enrich the TM with MT outputs and help the post-editor, instead of choosing the translation for the post-editor.</S>

        <HEADER>6.3 Comparing the MT, TM and Ranking Outputs</HEADER>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-2948">One of the interesting findings from Tables 3 and 4 is that according to the TER edit statistics, the MT outputs generally need a smaller number of edits than the TM and Ranking outputs.</S>
          <S ID="S-2949">This certainly confirms the necessity to integrate MT into today&#8217;s TM systems.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-2950">However, this fact should not lead to the conclusion that TMs should be replaced by MT completely.</S>
          <S ID="S-2951">First of all, all of our experiments exclude exact TM matches, as those translations will simply be reused and not translated.</S>
          <S ID="S-2952">While this is a realistic setting in the translation industry, it removes all sentences for which the TM works best from our evaluations.</S>
          <S ID="S-2953">Furthermore, Table 5 shows that the Best-in- Top5 Ranking output performs better than the MT outputs, hence there are TM outputs that lead to smaller number of edits.</S>
          <S ID="S-2954">As k increases, the ranking model is able to better utilize these outputs.</S>
          <S ID="S-2955">Finally, in this task we concentrate on ranking useful translations higher, but we are not interested in how useless translations are ranked.</S>
          <S ID="S-2956">Ranking SVM optimizes on the ranking of the whole list, which is slightly different from what we actually require.</S>
          <S ID="S-2957">One option is to use other optimization techniques that can make use of this property to get better Top-k edit statistics for a smaller k.</S>
          <S ID="S-2958">Another option is obviously to perform regression directly on the number of edits instead of modeling on the ranking.</S>
          <S ID="S-2959">We plan to explore these ideas in future work.</S>

      <P>
        <S ID="S-2964">In this paper we present a novel ranking-based model to integrate SMT into a TM system, in order to facilitate the work of post-editors.</S>
        <S ID="S-2965">In such</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-2966">a model, the user of the TM will be presented with an augmented k-best list, consisting of translations from both the TM and the MT systems, and ranked according to ascending prospective postediting effort.</S>
        <S ID="S-2967">From the post-editors&#8217; point of view, the TM remains intact.</S>
        <S ID="S-2968">And unlike in the binary translation recommendation, where only one translation recommendation is provided, the ranking model offers k-best post-editing candidates, enabling the user to use more resources when translating.</S>
        <S ID="S-2969">As we do not actually throw away any translation produced from the TM, the assets represented by the TM are preserved and the related estimation of the upper bound cost is still valid.</S>
        <S ID="S-2970">We extract system independent features from the MT and TM outputs and use Ranking SVMs to train the ranking model, which outperforms both the TM&#8217;s and MT&#8217;s k-best list w.r.t.</S>
        <S ID="S-2971">precision at k, for all ks.</S>
        <S ID="S-2972">We also analyze the edit statistics of the integrated k-best output using the TER edit statistics.</S>
        <S ID="S-2973">Our ranking model results in slightly increased number of edits compared to the MT output (apparently held back by a small number of poor TM outputs that are ranked high) for a smaller k, but requires less edits than both the MT and the TM output for a larger k.</S>
        <S ID="S-2974">This work can be extended in a number of ways.</S>
        <S ID="S-2975">Most importantly, We plan to conduct a user study to validate the effectiveness of the method and to gather HTER scores to train a better ranking model.</S>
        <S ID="S-2976">Furthermore, we will try to experiment with learning models that can further reduce the number of edit operations on the top ranked translations.</S>
        <S ID="S-2977">We also plan to improve the adaptability of this method and apply it beyond a specific domain and language pair.</S>
