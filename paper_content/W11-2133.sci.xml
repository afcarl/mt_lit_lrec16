  <ABSTRACT>
    <A-S ID="S-46944">This work presents a simplified approach to bilingual topic modeling for language model adaptation by combining text in the source and target language into very short documents and performing Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) during model training.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-46945">During inference, documents containing only the source language can be used to infer a full topic-word distribution on all words in the target language&#8217;s vocabulary, from which we perform Minimum Discrimination Information (MDI) adaptation on a background language model (LM).</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-46946">We apply our approach on the English-French IWSLT 2010 TED Talk exercise, and report a 15% reduction in perplexity and relative BLEU and NIST improvements of 3% and 2.4%, respectively over a baseline only using a 5-gram background LM over the entire translation task.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-46947">Our topic modeling approach is simpler to construct than its counterparts.</A-S>

        <S ID="S-46948">Adaptation is usually applied to reduce the performance drop of Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems when translating documents that deviate from training and tuning conditions.</S>
        <S ID="S-46949">In this paper, we focus primarily on language model (LM) adaptation.</S>
        <S ID="S-46950">In SMT, LMs are used to promote fluent translations.</S>

        <S ID="S-46956">When adaptation data represents the translation task domain one generally refers to domain adaptation, while when they just represent the content of the single document to be translated one typically refers to topic adaptation.</S>

        <S ID="S-46957">We propose a cross-language topic adaptation method, enabling the adaptation of a LM based on the topic distribution of the source document during translation.</S>
        <S ID="S-46958">We train a latent semantic topic model on a collection of bilingual documents, in which each document contains both the source and target language.</S>
        <S ID="S-46959">During inference, a latent topic distribution of words across both the source and target languages is inferred from a source document to be translated.</S>
        <S ID="S-46960">After inference, we remove all source language words from the topic-word distributions and construct a unigram language model which is used to adapt our background LM via Minimum Discrimination Information (MDI) estimation (<REF ID="R-05" RPTR="3">Federico, 1999</REF>, 2002; <REF ID="R-12" RPTR="12">Kneser et al., 1997</REF>).</S>

        <S ID="S-46973">Most works focus on monolingual language model adaptation in the context of automatic speech recognition.</S>
        <S ID="S-46974">Federico (2002) combines Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) (<REF ID="R-10" RPTR="10">Hofmann, 1999</REF>) for topic modeling with the minimum discrimination information (MDI) estimation criterion for speech recognition and notes an improvement in terms of perplexity and word error rate (WER).</S>
        <S ID="S-46975">Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) techniques have been proposed as an alternative to PLSA to construct purely generative models.</S>
        <S ID="S-46976">LDA techniques include variational Bayes (<REF ID="R-00" RPTR="0">Blei et al., 2003</REF>) and HMM-LDA (<REF ID="R-11" RPTR="11">Hsu and Glass, 2006</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-46977">Recently, bilingual approaches to topic modeling have also been proposed.</S>
        <S ID="S-46978">A Hidden Markov Bilingual Topic AdMixture (HM-BiTAM) model is proposed by Zhao and Xing <REF ID="R-07" RPTR="5">(2008)</REF><REF ID="R-22" RPTR="29">(2008)</REF>, which constructs a generative model in which words from a target language are sampled from a mixture of topics drawn from a Dirichlet distribution.</S>
        <S ID="S-46979">Foreign words are sampled via alignment links from a first-order Markov process and a topic specific translation lexicon.</S>
        <S ID="S-46980">While HM-BiTAM has been used for bilingual topic extraction and topic-specific lexicon mapping in the context of SMT, Zhao and Xing <REF ID="R-07" RPTR="6">(2008)</REF><REF ID="R-22" RPTR="30">(2008)</REF> note that HM-BiTAM can generate unigram language models for both the source and target language and thus can be used for language model adaptation through MDI in a similar manner as outlined in Federico (2002).</S>
        <S ID="S-46981">Another bilingual LSA approach is proposed by Tam et al. <REF ID="R-21" RPTR="27">(2007)</REF>, which consists of two hierarchical LDA models, constructed from parallel document corpora.</S>
        <S ID="S-46982">A one-to-one correspondence between LDA models is enforced by learning the hyperparameters of the variational Dirichlet posteriors in one LDA model and bootstrapping the second model by fixing the hyperparameters.</S>
        <S ID="S-46983">The technique is based on the assumption that the topic distributions of the source and target documents are identical.</S>
        <S ID="S-46984">It is shown by Tam et al. <REF ID="R-21" RPTR="28">(2007)</REF> that the bilingual LSA framework is also capable of adapting the translation model.</S>

      <HEADER>7 Conclusions</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-47155">An alternative approach to bilingual topic modeling has been presented that integrates the PLSA framework with MDI adaptation that can effectively adapt a background language model when given a document in the source language.</S>
        <S ID="S-47156">Rather than training two topic models and enforcing a one-to-one correspondence for translation, we use the assumption that parallel texts refer to the same topics and have a very similar topic distribution.</S>
        <S ID="S-47157">Preliminary experiments show a reduction in perplexity and an overall improvement in BLEU and NIST scores on speech translation.</S>
        <S ID="S-47158">We also note that, unlike previous works involving topic modeling, we did not remove stop words and punctuation, but rather assumed that these features would have a relatively uniform topic distribution.</S>
        <S ID="S-47159">One downside to the MDI adaptation approach is that the computation of the normalization term z(h) is expensive and potentially prohibitive during continuous speech translation tasks.</S>
        <S ID="S-47160">Further investigation is needed to determine if there is a suitable approximation that avoids computing probabilities across all n-grams.</S>
