        <S ID="S-32534">Syntax-based translation models, which exploit hierarchical structures of natural languages to guide machine translation, have become increasingly popular in recent years.</S>
        <S ID="S-32535">So far, most of them have been based on synchronous context-free grammars (CFG) (<REF ID="R-04" RPTR="4">Chiang, 2007</REF>), tree substitution grammars (TSG) (<REF ID="R-09" RPTR="14">Eisner, 2003</REF>; <REF ID="R-12" RPTR="20">Galley et al., 2006</REF>; <REF ID="R-20" RPTR="41">Liu et al., 2006</REF>; <REF ID="R-15" RPTR="26">Huang et al., 2006</REF>; Zhang et al., 2008), and inversion transduction grammars (ITG) (<REF ID="R-34" RPTR="68">Wu, 1997</REF>; <REF ID="R-36" RPTR="71">Xiong et al., 2006</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-32536">Although these formalisms present simple and precise mechanisms for describing the basic recursive structure of sentences, they are not powerful enough to model some important features of natural language syntax.</S>
        <S ID="S-32537">For example, <REF ID="R-03" RPTR="3">Chiang (2006)</REF><REF ID="R-16" RPTR="29">(2006)</REF><REF ID="R-21" RPTR="46">(2006)</REF><REF ID="R-26" RPTR="55">(2006)</REF> points out that the translation of languages that can stack an unbounded number of clauses in an &#8220;inside-out&#8221; way (<REF ID="R-34" RPTR="69">Wu, 1997</REF>) 1278</S>

        <S ID="S-32539">Therefore, it is necessary to find ways to take advantage of more powerful synchronous grammars to improve machine translation.</S>

        <S ID="S-32540">Synchronous tree adjoining grammars (TAG) (<REF ID="R-31" RPTR="65">Shieber and Schabes, 1990</REF>) are a good candidate.</S>
        <S ID="S-32541">As a formal tree rewriting system, TAG (<REF ID="R-17" RPTR="35">Joshi et al., 1975</REF>; <REF ID="R-18" RPTR="36">Joshi, 1985</REF>) provides a larger domain of locality than CFG to state linguistic dependencies that are far apart since the formalism treats trees as basic building blocks.</S>
        <S ID="S-32542">As a mildly context-sensitive grammar, TAG is conjectured to be powerful enough to model natural languages.</S>
        <S ID="S-32543">Synchronous TAG generalizes TAG by allowing the construction of a pair of trees using the TAG operations of substitution and adjoining on tree pairs.</S>
        <S ID="S-32544">The idea of using synchronous TAG in machine translation has been pursued by several researchers (<REF ID="R-00" RPTR="0">Abeille et al., 1990</REF>; <REF ID="R-29" RPTR="63">Prigent, 1994</REF>; <REF ID="R-08" RPTR="13">Dras, 1999</REF>), but only recently in its probabilistic form (<REF ID="R-25" RPTR="54">Nesson et al., 2006</REF>; De- Neefe and Knight, 2009).</S>
        <S ID="S-32545"><REF ID="R-32" RPTR="66">Shieber (2007)</REF> argues that probabilistic synchronous TAG possesses appealing properties such as expressivity and trainability for building a machine translation system.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-32546">However, one major challenge for applying synchronous TAG to machine translation is computational complexity.</S>
        <S ID="S-32547">While TAG requires O(n 6 ) time for monolingual parsing, synchronous TAG requires O(n 12 ) for bilingual parsing.</S>
        <S ID="S-32548">One solution is to use tree insertion grammars (TIG) introduced by <REF ID="R-30" RPTR="64">Schabes and Waters (1995)</REF>.</S>
        <S ID="S-32549">As a restricted form of TAG, TIG still allows for adjoining of unbounded trees but only requires O(n 3 ) time for monolingual parsing.</S>
