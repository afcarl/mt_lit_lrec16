      <P>
        <S ID="S-48286">This year, LIG and LIA have combined their efforts to produce a joint submission to WMT 2011 for the French-English translation task.</S>
        <S ID="S-48287">Each group started by developing its own solution whilst sharing resources (corpora as provided by the organizers but also aligned data etc) and acquired knowledge (current parameters, effect of the size of n-grams, etc.) with the other.</S>
        <S ID="S-48288">Both LIG and LIA systems are standard phrase-based translation systems based on the</S>

        <S ID="S-48290">The final LIGA submission is a combination of the two systems.</S>
        <S ID="S-48291">We summarize in Section 2 the resources used and the main characteristics of the systems.</S>

        <P>
          <S ID="S-48296">Globally, our system 1 was built using all the French and English data supplied for the workshop&#8217;s shared translation task, apart from the Gigaword monolingual corpora released by the LDC.</S>
          <S ID="S-48297">Table 1 sums up the used data and introduces designations that we follow in the remainder of this paper to refer to corpora.</S>
          <S ID="S-48298">Four corpora were used to build translation models: news-c, euro, UN and giga, while three others are employed to train monolingual language models (LMs).</S>
          <S ID="S-48299">Three bilingual corpora were devoted to model tuning: test09 was used for the development of the two seed systems (LIG and LIA), whereas test08 and testcomb08 were used to tune the weights for system combination.</S>

          <S ID="S-48302">All the data were first tokenized with the tokenizer provided for the workshop.</S>
          <S ID="S-48303">Kneser- Ney discounted LMs were built from monolingual corpora using the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002), while bilingual corpora were aligned at the wordlevel using GIZA++ (<REF ID="R-07" RPTR="7">Och and Ney, 2003</REF>) or its multi-threaded version MGIZA++ (<REF ID="R-01" RPTR="1">Gao and Vogel, 2008</REF>) for the large corpora UN and giga.</S>
          <S ID="S-48304">Phrase table and lexicalized reordering models were built with MOSES (<REF ID="R-05" RPTR="5">Koehn et al., 2007</REF>).</S>

          <S ID="S-48327">The fist set has low cut-offs: 1-2-3-3 (respectively for 1-gram, 2-gram, 3-gram and 4-gram counts), whereas the second one (LM 2 ) is more aggressive: 1-5-7-7.</S>
          <S ID="S-48328">Experiment results (Table 3, Systems 3 and 4) show that resorting to LM 2 leads to an improvement of BLEU with respect to LM 1 .</S>

          <S ID="S-48345">Since this technique drastically reduces the size of the phrase table, while not degrading (and even slightly improving) the results on the development and test corpora (System 6), we decided to employ filtered phrase tables in the final configuration of the LIG system.</S>

          <S ID="S-48368">We significantly cleaned up the crawled parallel giga corpus, keeping 19.3 M of the original 22.5 M sentence pairs.</S>
          <S ID="S-48369">For example, sentence pairs with numerous numbers, nonalphanumeric characters or words starting with capital letters were removed.</S>
          <S ID="S-48370">The whole training material is truecased, meaning that the words occuring after a strong punctuation mark were lowercased when they belonged to a dictionary of common alllowercased forms; the others were left unchanged.</S>

        <P>
          <S ID="S-48371">The training of a 5-gram English LM was restrained to the news corpora mono-news-c and newss that we consider large enough to ignore other data.</S>
          <S ID="S-48372">In order to reduce the size of the LM, we first limited the vocabulary of our model to a 1 M word vocabulary taking the most frequent words in the news corpora.</S>
          <S ID="S-48373">We also resorted to cut-offs to discard infrequent n-grams (2-2-3-5 thresholds on 2- to 5-gram counts) and uses the SRILM option prune, which allowed us to train the LM on large data with 32 Gb RAM.</S>
          <S ID="S-48374">Our translation models are phrase-based models (PBMs) built with MOSES with the following nondefault settings:</S>

          <S ID="S-48377">Weights of LM, phrase table and lexicalized reordering model scores were optimized on the development corpus thanks to the MERT algorithm.</S>

          <S ID="S-48382">This dramatically reduced phrase tables by dividing their size by a factor of 5 but did not improve our best configuration from the BLEU score perspective (Table 4, line 1); the method was therefore not kept in the LIA system.</S>
          <S ID="S-48383">Secondly, we introduced reordering constraints in order to consider quoted material as a block.</S>
          <S ID="S-48384">This method is particularly useful when citations included in sentences have to be translated.</S>
          <S ID="S-48385">Two configurations were tested: zone markups inclusion around quotes and wall markups inclusion within zone markups.</S>

        <P>
          <S ID="S-48387">As the only news parallel corpus provided for the workshop contains 116 k sentence pairs, we must resort to parallel out-of-domain corpora in order to build reliable translation models.</S>
          <S ID="S-48388">Information retrieval (IR) methods have been used in the past to subsample parallel corpora.</S>
          <S ID="S-48389">For example, <REF ID="R-02" RPTR="2">Hildebrand et al. (2005)</REF> used sentences belonging to the development and test corpora as queries to select the k most similar source sentences in an indexed parallel corpus.</S>
          <S ID="S-48390">The retrieved sentence pairs constituted a training corpus for the translation models.</S>
          <S ID="S-48391">The RALI submission for WMT10 proposed a similar approach that builds queries from the monolingual news corpus in order to select sentence pairs stylistically close to the news domain (<REF ID="R-03" RPTR="3">Huet et al., 2010</REF>).</S>
          <S ID="S-48392">This method has the major interest that it does not require to build a new training parallel corpus for each news data set to translate.</S>
          <S ID="S-48393">Following the best configuration tested in (Huet et al.,</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-48394">2010), we index the three out-of-domain corpora using LEMUR 3 , and build queries from English news-s sentences where stop words are removed.</S>
          <S ID="S-48395">The 10 top sentence pairs retrieved per query are selected and added to the new training corpus if they are not redundant with a sentence pair already collected.</S>
          <S ID="S-48396">The process is repeated until the training parallel corpus reaches a threshold over the number of retrieved pairs.</S>
          <S ID="S-48397">Table 4 reports BLEU scores obtained with the LIA system using the in-domain corpus news-c and various amounts of out-of-domain data.</S>
          <S ID="S-48398">MERT was re-run for each set of training data.</S>
          <S ID="S-48399">The first four lines display results obtained with the same number of sentence pairs, which corresponds to the size of news-c appended to euro.</S>
          <S ID="S-48400">The experiments show that using euro instead of the first sentences of UN and giga significantly improves BLEU scores, which indicates the better adequacy of euro with respect to the test10 corpus.</S>
          <S ID="S-48401">The use of the IR method to select sentences from euro, UN and giga leads to a similar BLEU score to the one obtained with euro.</S>
          <S ID="S-48402">The increase of the collected pairs up to 3 M pairs generates a significant improvement of 0.9 BLEU point.</S>
          <S ID="S-48403">A further rise of the amount of collected pairs does not introduce a major gain since retrieving 10 M sentence pairs only augments BLEU from 29.1 to 29.3.</S>
          <S ID="S-48404">This last configuration which leads to the best BLEU was used to build the final LIA system.</S>
          <S ID="S-48405">Let us note that 2 M, 3 M and 15 M queries were required to respectively obtain 3 M, 5 M and 10 M sentence pairs because of the removal of redundant sentences in the increased corpus.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-48406">For a matter of comparison, a system was also built taking into account all the training material, i.e. 37 M sentence pairs 4 .</S>
          <S ID="S-48407">This last system is outperformed by our best system built with IR and has finally close performance to the one obtained with news-c+euro relatively to the quantity of used data.</S>

      <HEADER>5 The system combination</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-48409">System combination is based on the 500-best outputs generated by the LIA and the LIG systems.</S>

        <S ID="S-48415">Each N-best list is associated with a set of 14 scores and combined in several steps.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-48416">The first step takes as input lowercased 500-best lists, since preliminary experiments have shown a better behavior using only lowercased output (with cased output, combination presents some degradations).</S>
        <S ID="S-48417">The score combination weights are optimized on the development corpus, in order to maximize the BLEU score at the sentence level when N-best lists are reordered according to the 14 available scores.</S>
        <S ID="S-48418">To this end, we resorted to the SRILM nbest-optimize tool to do a simplex-based Amoeba search (<REF ID="R-10" RPTR="11">Press et al., 1988</REF>) on the error function with multiple restarts to avoid local minima.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-48419">Once the optimized feature weights are computed independently for each system, N-best lists are turned into confusion networks (<REF ID="R-06" RPTR="6">Mangu et al., 2000</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-48420">The 14 features are used to compute posteriors relatively to all the hypotheses in the N-best list.</S>
        <S ID="S-48421">Confusion networks are computed for each sentence and for each system.</S>
        <S ID="S-48422">In Table 5 we present the ROVER (<REF ID="R-00" RPTR="0">Fiscus, 1997</REF>) results for the LIA and LIG confusion networks (LIA CNC and LIG CNC).</S>
        <S ID="S-48423">Then, both confusion networks computed for each sentence are merged into a single one.</S>
        <S ID="S-48424">A ROVER is applied on the combined confusion network and generates a lowercased 1-best.</S>
        <S ID="S-48425">The final step aims at producing cased hypotheses.</S>

      <P>
        <S ID="S-48428">LIG system trained on lowercased corpora (Table 5, two last lines).</S>
        <S ID="S-48429">In order to get an improvement when combining the outputs, we had to adopt the following strategy.</S>
        <S ID="S-48430">The 500-best truecased outputs of the LIA system are first merged in a word graph (and not a mesh lattice).</S>
        <S ID="S-48431">Then, the lowercased 1-best previously obtained with ROVER is aligned with the graph in order to find the closest existing path, which is equivalent to matching an oracle with the graph.</S>
        <S ID="S-48432">This method allows for several benefits.</S>
        <S ID="S-48433">The new hypothesis is based on a &#8220;true&#8221; decoding pass generated by a truecased system and discarded marginal hypotheses.</S>
        <S ID="S-48434">Moreover, the selected path offers a better BLEU score than the initial hypothesis with and without case.</S>
        <S ID="S-48435">This method is better than the one which consists of applying the LIG recaser (section 3.6) on the combined (un-cased) hypothesis.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-48436">The new recased one-best hypothesis is then used as the final submission for WMT.</S>
        <S ID="S-48437">Our combination approach improves on test11 the best single system by 0.5 case-insensitive BLEU point and by 0.4 case-sensitive BLEU (Table 5).</S>
        <S ID="S-48438">However, it also introduces some mistakes by duplicating in particular some segments.</S>
        <S ID="S-48439">We plan to apply rules at the segment level in order to reduce these artifacts.</S>

      <HEADER>6 Conclusion</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-48440">This paper presented two statistical machine translation systems developed at different sites using MOSES and the combination of these systems.</S>
        <S ID="S-48441">The LIGA submission presented this year was ranked among the best MT system for the French-English direction.</S>
        <S ID="S-48442">This campaign was the first shot for LIA and the second for LIG.</S>
        <S ID="S-48443">Beside following the traditional pipeline for building a phrase-based translation system, each individual system led to specific works: LIG worked on using SPE as post-treatment, LIA focused on extracting useful data from largesized corpora.</S>
        <S ID="S-48444">And their combination implied to address the interesting issue of matching results from systems with different casing approaches.</S>
        <S ID="S-48445">WMT is a great opportunity to chase after performance and joining our efforts has allowed to save considerable amount of time for data preparation and tuning choices (even when final decisions were different among systems), yet obtaining very competitive results.</S>
        <S ID="S-48446">This year, our goal was to develop state-of-the-art systems so as to investigate new approaches for related topics such as translation with human-in-the-loop or multilingual interaction systems (e.g. vocal telephone information-query dialogue systems in multiple languages or language portability of such systems).</S>
