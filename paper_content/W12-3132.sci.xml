        <S ID="S-7025">However, the area of possible application of formemes is not limited to MT only or to the language pair used in our system; the underlying ideas are language-independent.</S>

        <S ID="S-7026">We summarize the development of morphosyntactic annotations related to formemes (Section 2), provide an overview of the whole TectoMT system (Section 3), then describe the formeme annotation (Section 4) and our recent improvements (Section 5), as well as experimental applications, including English-Czech MT (Section 6).</S>
        <S ID="S-7027">The main asset of the formeme revision is a first systematic reorganization of the existing practical aid, providing it with a solid theoretical base, but still bearing its intended applications in mind.</S>

        <S ID="S-7053">The TectoMT system is a structural machine translation system with deep transfer, first introduced by &#381;abokrtsk&#253; et al. (2008).</S>
        <S ID="S-7054">It currently supports English-to-Czech translation.</S>

      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-7056">The transfer phase of the system is based on Maximum Entropy context-sensitive translation models (<REF ID="R-12" RPTR="15">Mare&#269;ek et al., 2010</REF>) and Hidden Tree Markov Models (<REF ID="R-27" RPTR="35">&#381;abokrtsk&#253; and Popel, 2009</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-7057">It is factorized into three subtasks: lemma, formeme and grammatemes translation (see Sections 3.2 and 3.3).</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-7058">The subsequent generation phase consists of rulebased components that gradually change the deep target language representation into a shallow one, which is then converted to text (cf. Section 6.1).</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-7059">The version of TectoMT submitted to WMT12 2 builds upon the WMT11 version.</S>
        <S ID="S-7060">Several rule-based components were slightly refined.</S>
        <S ID="S-7061">However, most of the effort was devoted to creating a better and bigger parallel treebank&#8212;CzEng 1.0 3 (<REF ID="R-02" RPTR="4">Bojar et al., 2012</REF>b), and re-training the statistical components on this resource.</S>
        <S ID="S-7062">Apart from bigger size and improved filtering, one of the main differences between CzEng 0.9 (<REF ID="R-00" RPTR="0">Bojar and &#381;abokrtsk&#253;, 2009</REF>) (used in WMT11) and CzEng 1.0 (used in WMT12) is the revised annotation of formemes.</S>

          <S ID="S-7039">A deep syntax/semantic layer describing the linguistic meaning of the sentence.</S>
          <S ID="S-7040">Its dependency trees include only content words as nodes, assigning to each of them a deep lemma (t-lemma), a semantic role label (functor), and other deep linguistic features (grammatemes), such as semantic partof-speech, person, tense or modality.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-7041">The analytical layer can be obtained using different dependency parsers (<REF ID="R-16" RPTR="19">Popel et al., 2011</REF>); the tectogrammatical representation is then created by rulebased modules from the analytical trees.</S>

        <HEADER>3.2 Transfer: Translation Factorization and Symmetry</HEADER>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-7043">Using the tectogrammatical representation in structural MT allows separating the problem of translating a sentence into relatively independent simpler subtasks: lemma, functors, and grammatemes translation (<REF ID="R-01" RPTR="1">Bojar et al., 2009</REF>; <REF ID="R-26" RPTR="31">&#381;abokrtsk&#253;, 2010</REF>).</S>
          <S ID="S-7044">Since topology changes to deep syntax trees are rare in MT transfer, each of these three subtasks allows a virtually symmetric source-target one-to-one mapping, thus simplifying the initial n-to-m mapping of word phrases or surface subtrees.</S>
          <S ID="S-7045">&#381;abokrtsk&#253; et al. (2008) obviated the need for transfer via functors (i.e. semantic role detection) by applying a formeme transfer instead.</S>
          <S ID="S-7046">While formeme values are much simpler to obtain by automatic processing, this approach preserved the advantage of symmetric one-to-one value translation.</S>

        <P>
          <S ID="S-7049">Surface-oriented formemes have been introduced into the semantics-oriented tectogrammatical layer, as it proves beneficial to combine the deep syntax trees, smaller in size and more consistent across languages, with the surface morphology and syntax to provide for a straightforward transition to the surface level (<REF ID="R-26" RPTR="32">&#381;abokrtsk&#253;, 2010</REF>).</S>

        <P>

          <S ID="S-7051">As the translation of lemmas and their morpho-syntactic forms is separated, combinations unseen in the training data may appear on the output.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-7052">To further reduce data sparsity, only minimal information needed to reconstruct the surface form is stored in formemes; morphological categories derivable from elsewhere, i.e. morphological agreement or grammatemes, are discarded.</S>

        <S ID="S-7137">We have presented a systematic and theoretically supported revision of a surface morpho-syntactic markup within a deep dependency annotation scenario, designed to facilitate the TectoMT transfer phase.</S>
        <S ID="S-7138">Our first practical experiments proved the merits of our innovations in the tasks of Czech synthesis and deep structural MT as a whole.</S>

        <S ID="S-7140">1-1.5% accuracy).</S>
        <S ID="S-7141">In future, we intend to tune the rule-based parts of our MT transfer for the new version of formemes and examine further possibilities of data sparsity reduction (e.g. by merging synonymous formemes).</S>
        <S ID="S-7142">We are also planning to create formeme annotation modules for further languages to widen the range of language pairs used in the TectoMT system.</S>
