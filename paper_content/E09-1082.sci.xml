      <HEADER>1 Introduction</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-18756">Multi-source statistical machine translation was first formally defined by <REF ID="R-11" RPTR="13">Och and Ney (2001)</REF> as the process of translating multiple meaningequivalent source language texts into a single target language.</S>
        <S ID="S-18757">Multi-source translation is of particular use when translating a document that has already been translated into several languages, either by humans or machines, and needs to be further translated into other target languages.</S>
        <S ID="S-18758">This situation occurs often in large multi-lingual organisations such as the United Nations and the European Parliament, which must translate their proceedings into the languages of the member institutions.</S>
        <S ID="S-18759">It is also common in multi-national companies, which need to translate product and marketing documentation for their different markets.</S>
        <S ID="S-18760">Clearly, any existing translations for a document can help automatic translation into other languages.</S>
        <S ID="S-18761">These different versions of the input can resolve deficiencies and ambiguities (e.g., syntactic and semantic ambiguity) present in a single input, resulting in higher quality translation output.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-18762">In this paper, we present three models of multisource translation, with increasing degrees of sophistication, which we compare empirically on a number of different corpora.</S>
        <S ID="S-18763">We generalize the definition of multi-source translation to include any translation case with multiple inputs and a single output, allowing for, e.g., multiple paraphrased inputs in a single language.</S>
        <S ID="S-18764">Our methods include simple output selection, which treats the multisource translation task as many independent translation steps followed by selection of one of their outputs (<REF ID="R-11" RPTR="16">Och and Ney, 2001</REF>), and output combination, which uses consensus decoding to construct a string from n-gram fragments of the translation outputs (<REF ID="R-00" RPTR="1">Bangalore et al., 2001</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-18765">We also present a novel method, input combination, in which we compile the input texts into a compact lattice, over which we perform a single decoding pass.</S>
        <S ID="S-18766">We show that as we add additional inputs, the simplest output selection method performs quite poorly relative to a single input translation system, while the latter two methods are able to make better use of the additional inputs.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-18767">The paper is structured as follows.</S>
        <S ID="S-18768">&#167;2 presents the three methods for multi-source translation in detail: output selection, output combination, and our novel lattice-based method for input combination.</S>
        <S ID="S-18769">We report experiments applying these techniques to three different corpora, with both monolingual inputs (&#167;3) and multilingual inputs (&#167;4).</S>
        <S ID="S-18770">We finish in &#167;5 by analyzing the benefits and drawbacks of these approaches.</S>

      <HEADER>2 Approaches to Multi-Source Translation</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-18899">We now present three ways to combine multiple inputs into a single output translation, in the context of related work for each technique.</S>

        <HEADER>2.1 Output Selection</HEADER>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-18771">The most straightforward approach to multisource translation, proposed by <REF ID="R-11" RPTR="14">Och and Ney (2001)</REF>, is to independently translate each of the N source languages and then select a single translation from the outputs.</S>

          <S ID="S-18782">Och and Ney present two approaches for selecting a single target from these outputs.</S>
          <S ID="S-18783">The first, PROD, finds the maximiser of the p(t) &#8719; N</S>

        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-18786">p(t) is the language model probability.</S>
          <S ID="S-18787">For reasons of tractability, the maximisation is performed only over targets generated by the translation systems, t N 1 , not the full space of all translations.</S>
          <S ID="S-18788">The PROD method requires each model to provide a model score for each t n generated by the other models.</S>
          <S ID="S-18789">However, this is often impossible due to the models&#8217; highly divergent output spaces (<REF ID="R-17" RPTR="26">Schwartz, 2008</REF>), and therefore the technique cannot be easily applied.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-18790">The second approach, MAX, solves arg max t&#8712;t N max N 1 n=1 p(t)p n(s n |t), which is much easier to calculate.</S>
          <S ID="S-18791">As with PROD, the translation models&#8217; outputs are used for the candidate translations.</S>
          <S ID="S-18792">While different models may have different score ranges, <REF ID="R-11" RPTR="15">Och and Ney (2001)</REF> state that there is little benefit in weighting these scores to normalise the output range.</S>
          <S ID="S-18793">In their experiments, they show that MAX used on pairs or triples of language inputs can outperform a model with single language input, but that performance degrades as more languages are added.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-18794">These methods limit the explored space to a full translation output of one of the inputs, and therefore cannot make good use of the full diversity of the translations.</S>
          <S ID="S-18795">In this paper we present MAX scores as a baseline for output selection, and approximate an oracle using the BLEU metric as an upper bound for the output selection technique.</S>

        <HEADER>2.2 Output Combination</HEADER>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-18796">Consensus decoding as a form of system combination is typically used to integrate the outputs of multiple translation systems into a single synthetic output that seeks to combine the best fragments from each component system.</S>
          <S ID="S-18797">Multi-source translation can be treated as a special case of consensus decoding.</S>

          <S ID="S-18805">One class of approaches to consensus decoding focuses on construction of a confusion network or lattice 1 from translation outputs, from which new sentences can be created using different reorderings or combinations of translation fragments (e.g., <REF ID="R-00" RPTR="0">Bangalore et al. (2001)</REF>; <REF ID="R-15" RPTR="20">Rosti et al. (2007</REF><REF ID="R-16" RPTR="23">Rosti et al. (2007</REF>b)).</S>
          <S ID="S-18806">These methods differ in the types of lattices used, their means of creation, and scoring method used to extract the best consensus output from the lattice.</S>
          <S ID="S-18807">The system used in this paper is a variant of the one proposed in <REF ID="R-15" RPTR="21">Rosti et al. (2007</REF><REF ID="R-16" RPTR="24">Rosti et al. (2007</REF>a), which we now describe in detail.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-18808">The first step in forming a lattice is to align the inputs.</S>
          <S ID="S-18809">Consensus decoding systems often use the script of edit operations that minimises the translation edit rate (TER; <REF ID="R-18" RPTR="27">Snover et al. (2006)</REF>).</S>
          <S ID="S-18810">TER is a word-based measure of edit distance which also allows n-gram shifts when calculating the best match between a hypothesis and reference.</S>
          <S ID="S-18811">Because TER describes the correspondence between the hypothesis and reference as a sequence of insertions, substitutions, deletions, and shifts, the edit script it produces can be used to create a confusion network.</S>
          <S ID="S-18812">Consider a reference of &#8220;The dog barked very loudly&#8221; and a hypothesis &#8220;A big dog loudly barked.&#8221; The TER alignment is shown in Table 1, along with the edit operations.</S>
          <S ID="S-18813">Note that the matching &#8220;barked&#8221; tokens are labelled shift, as one needs to be shifted for this match to occur.</S>
          <S ID="S-18814">Using the shifted hypothesis, we can form a confusion</S>

          <S ID="S-18816">We define a lattice as a weighted directed acyclic graph, and a confusion network as a special case where each node n in the ordered graph has word arcs only to node n + 1.</S>

          <S ID="S-18824">We then form a lattice of confusion networks (Figure 2), assigning a prior weight to each confusion network based on the average TER of the selected skeleton with the other hypotheses.</S>

          <S ID="S-19003">We choose to evaluate translation performance at three combination levels: two languages (French and Swedish), three languages (+Spanish), and six languages (+Danish, Portuguese, Italian).</S>
          <S ID="S-19004">For each combination we apply MAX, SYSCOMB, French skeleton lattice input translation LATTICE, and monotone decoding over multiple skeleton lattices, MULTILATTICE.</S>

          <S ID="S-19017">With input combination, we are forced by the decoder to take the maximum scoring path through the lattice, but in output combination we have the aggregate vote of word confidences generated by each system.</S>
          <S ID="S-19018">If we could combine word arc scores across inputs, as in output combination, we might get a more robust solution for taking advantage of the available similarities on the target side of the translation.</S>

          <S ID="S-19022">Another difference is the richer space of reorderings in TER-based lattices, due to the ability of the metric to handle long-distance alignments.</S>

      <HEADER>5 Conclusion</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-19026">We analyzed three approaches for dealing with multi-source translation.</S>
        <S ID="S-19027">While MAX is mostly a poor performer, the upper bound of output selection is stunning.</S>
        <S ID="S-19028">The very positive results for output system combination across all data conditions are quite promising.</S>
        <S ID="S-19029">Output combination achieves these results while the using the limited expressive power of n-best inputs.</S>
        <S ID="S-19030">The potential of using a more expressive format &#8211; such as lattices that represent the joint search space of multiple models &#8211; is high.</S>
        <S ID="S-19031">Our first attempts at adapting lattices to multi-source translation input show promise for future development.</S>
        <S ID="S-19032">We have only scratched the surface of methods for constructing input lattices, and plan to actively continue research into improving these methods.</S>
