      <HEADER>1 Introduction</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-347779">Compilation of translation lexicons is a crucial process for machine translation (MT) (<REF ID="R-01" RPTR="1">Brown et al., 1990</REF>) and cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) systems (<REF ID="R-12" RPTR="14">Nie et al., 1999</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-347780">A lot of effort has been spent on constructing translation lexicons from domain-specific corpora in an automatic way (<REF ID="R-11" RPTR="9">Melamed, 2000</REF>; <REF ID="R-16" RPTR="21">Smadja et al., 1996</REF>; <REF ID="R-08" RPTR="5">Kupiec, 1993</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-347781">However, such methods encounter two fundamental problems: translation of regional variations and the lack of up-to-date and high-lexical-coverage corpus source, which are worthy of further investigation.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-347782">The first problem is resulted from the fact that the translations of a term may have variations in different dialectal regions.</S>
        <S ID="S-347783">Translation lexicons constructed with conventional methods may not adapt to regional usages.</S>
        <S ID="S-347784">For example, a Chinese-English lexicon constructed using a Hong Kong corpus cannot be directly adapted to the use in mainland China and Taiwan.</S>
        <S ID="S-347785">An obvious example is that the word &#8220;taxi&#8221; is normally translated into &#8220; &#30340; &#22763; &#8221; (Chinese transliteration of taxi) in Hong Kong, which is completely different from the translated Chinese words of &#8220; &#20986; &#31199; &#36710; &#8221; (rental cars) in mainland China and &#8220; &#35336; &#31243; &#36554; &#8221; (cars with meters) in Taiwan.</S>
        <S ID="S-347786">Besides, transliterations of a term are often pronounced differently across regions.</S>
        <S ID="S-347787">For example, the company name &#8220;Sony&#8221; is transliterated into &#8220; &#26032; &#21147; &#8221; (xinli) in Taiwan and &#8220; &#32034; &#23612; &#8221; (suoni) in mainland China.</S>
        <S ID="S-347788">Such terms, in today&#8217;s increasingly internationalized world, are appearing more and more often.</S>
        <S ID="S-347789">It is believed that their translations should reflect the cultural aspects across different dialectal regions.</S>
        <S ID="S-347790">Translations without consideration of the regional usages will lead to many serious misunderstandings, especially if the context to the original terms is not available.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-347791"><REF ID="R-06" RPTR="4">Halpern (2000)</REF> discussed the importance of translating simplified and traditional Chinese lexemes that are semantically, not orthographically, equivalent in various regions.</S>
        <S ID="S-347792">However, previous work on constructing translation lexicons for use in different regions was limited.</S>
        <S ID="S-347793">That might be resulted from the other problem that most of the conventional approaches are based heavily on domain-specific corpora.</S>
        <S ID="S-347794">Such corpora may be insufficient, or unavailable, for certain domains.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-347795">The Web is becoming the largest data repository in the world.</S>
        <S ID="S-347796">A number of studies have been reported on experiments in the use of the Web to complement insufficient corpora.</S>
        <S ID="S-347797">Most of them (Kilgarriff et al., 2003) tried to automatically collect parallel texts of different language versions (e.g. English and Chinese), instead of different regional versions (e.g. Chinese in Hong Kong and Taiwan), from the Web.</S>
        <S ID="S-347798">These methods are feasible but only certain pairs of languages and subject domains can extract sufficient parallel texts as corpora.</S>
        <S ID="S-347799">Different from the previous work, <REF ID="R-10" RPTR="8">Lu et al. (2002)</REF> utilized Web anchor texts as a comparable bilingual corpus source to extract translations for out-of-vocabulary terms (OOV), the terms not covered by general translation dictionaries.</S>
        <S ID="S-347800">This approach is applicable to the compilation of translation lexicons in diverse domains but requires powerful crawlers and high network bandwidth to gather Web data.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-347801">It is fortunate that the Web contains rich pages in a mixture of two or more languages for some lan-</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-347802">guage pairs such as Asian languages and English.</S>
        <S ID="S-347803">Many of them contain bilingual translations of terms, including OOV terms, e.g. companies&#8217;, personal and technical names.</S>
        <S ID="S-347804">In addition, geographic information about Web pages also provides useful clues to the regions where translations appear.</S>
        <S ID="S-347805">We are, therefore, interested in realizing whether these nice characteristics make it possible to automatically construct multilingual translation lexicons with regional variations.</S>
        <S ID="S-347806">Real search engines, such as Google (http://www.google.com) and AltaVista (http://www.</S>
        <S ID="S-347807">altavista.com), allow us to search English terms only for pages in a certain language, e.g. Chinese or Japanese.</S>
        <S ID="S-347808">This motivates us to investigate how to construct translation lexicons from bilingual searchresult pages (as the corpus), which are normally returned in a long ordered list of snippets of summaries (including titles and page descriptions) to help users locate interesting pages.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-347809">The purpose of this paper is trying to propose a systematic approach to create multilingual translation lexicons with regional variations through mining of bilingual search-result pages.</S>
        <S ID="S-347810">The bilingual pages retrieved by a term in one language are adopted as the corpus for extracting its translations in another language.</S>
        <S ID="S-347811">Three major problems are found and have to be dealt with, including: (1) extracting translations for unknown terms &#8211; how to extract translations with correct lexical boundaries from noisy bilingual search-result pages, and how to estimate term similarity for determining correct translations from the extracted candidates; (2) finding translations with regional variations &#8211; how to find regional translation variations that seldom cooccur in the same Web pages, and how to identify the corresponding languages of the retrieved searchresult pages once if the location clues (e.g. URLs) in them might not imply the language they are written in; and (3) translation with limited corpora &#8211; how to translate terms with insufficient search-result pages for particular pairs of languages such as Chinese and Japanese, and simplified Chinese and traditional Chinese.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-347812">The goal of this paper is to deal with the three problems.</S>
        <S ID="S-347813">Given a term in one language, all possible translations will be extracted from the obtained bilingual search-result pages based on their similarity to the term.</S>
        <S ID="S-347814">For those language pairs with unavailable corpora, a transitive translation model is proposed, by which the source term is translated into the target language through an intermediate language.</S>
        <S ID="S-347815">The transitive translation model is further enhanced by a competitive linking algorithm.</S>
        <S ID="S-347816">The algorithm can effectively alleviate the problem of error propagation in the process of translation, where translation errors may occur due to incorrect identification of the ambiguous terms in the intermediate language.</S>
        <S ID="S-347817">In addition, because the search-result pages might contain snippets that do not be really written in the target language, a filtering process is further performed to eliminate the translation variations not of interest.</S>
        <S ID="S-347818">Several experiments have been conducted to examine the performance of the proposed approach.</S>
        <S ID="S-347819">The experimental results have shown that the approach can generate effective translation equivalents of various terms &#8211; especially for OOV terms such as proper nouns and technical names, which can be used to enrich general translation dictionaries.</S>
        <S ID="S-347820">The results also revealed that the created translation lexicons can reflect different cultural aspects across regions such as Taiwan, Hong Kong and mainland China.</S>

          <S ID="S-347859">Transitive translation is particularly necessary for the translation of terms with regional variations because the variations seldom co-occur in the same bilingual pages.</S>
          <S ID="S-347860">To estimate the possibility of being the translation t &#338;T of term s, the transitive translation model first performs so-called direct translation, which attempts to learn translational equivalents directly from the corpus.</S>
          <S ID="S-347861">The direct translation method is simple, but strongly affected by the quality of the adopted corpus.</S>

          <S ID="S-347865">For example, a term in simplified Chinese, e.g. &#20114; &#32852; &#32593; (Internet) does not usually co-occur together with its variation in traditional Chinese, e.g. &#32178; &#38555; &#32178; &#36335; (Internet).</S>
          <S ID="S-347866">To deal with this problem, our idea is that the term s can be first translated into an intermediate translation m, which might co-occur with s, via a third (or intermediate) language l m .</S>
          <S ID="S-347867">The correct translation t can then be extracted if it can be found as a translation of m.</S>

          <S ID="S-347870">That is, incorrect m will significantly reduce the accuracy of the translation of s into t.</S>
          <S ID="S-347871">A typical case is the indirect association problem (<REF ID="R-11" RPTR="10">Melamed, 2000</REF>), as shown in Figure 2 in which we want to translate the term s 1 (s=s 1 ).</S>

        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-347900">Although the chi-square method is simple to compute, it is more applicable to high-frequency terms than low-frequency terms since the former are more likely to appear with their candidates.</S>
          <S ID="S-347901">Moreover, certain candidates that frequently co-occur with term s may not imply that they are appropriate translations.</S>
          <S ID="S-347902">Thus, another method is presented.</S>
          <S ID="S-347903">The Context-Vector Method: The basic idea of this method is that the term s&#8217;s translation equivalents may share common contextual terms with s in the search-result pages, similar to <REF ID="R-13" RPTR="16">Rapp (1999)</REF>.</S>
          <S ID="S-347904">For both s and its candidates C, we take their contextual terms constituting the search-result pages as their features.</S>
          <S ID="S-347905">The similarity between s and each candidate in C will be computed based on their feature vectors in the vector-space model.</S>
          <S ID="S-347906">Herein, we adopt the conventional tf-idf weighting scheme to estimate the significance of features and define it as:</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-347907">where f(t i ,p) is the frequency of term t i in search-result page p, N is the total number of Web pages, and n is the number of the pages containing t i .</S>
          <S ID="S-347908">Finally, the similarity between term s and its translation candidate t can be estimated with the cosine measure, i.e. S (s,t)=cos(cv s , cv t ), where cv s and cv t are the context vectors of s and t, respectively.</S>
          <S ID="S-347909">In the context-vector method, a low-frequency term still has a chance of extracting correct translations, if it shares common contexts with its translations in the search-result pages.</S>
          <S ID="S-347910">Although the method provides an effective way to overcome the chi-square method&#8217;s problem, its performance depends heavily on the quality of the retrieved search-result pages, such as the sizes and amounts of snippets.</S>
          <S ID="S-347911">Also, feature selection needs to be carefully handled in some cases.</S>
          <S ID="S-347912">The Combined Method: The context-vector and chisquare methods are basically complementary.</S>
          <S ID="S-347913">Intuitively, a more complete solution is to integrate the two methods.</S>
          <S ID="S-347914">Considering the various ranges of similarity values between the two methods, we compute the similarity between term s and its translation candidate t by the weighted sum of 1/R &#967; 2(s,t) and 1/R CV (s,t).</S>
          <S ID="S-347915">R &#967; 2(s,t) (or R CV (s,t)) represents the similarity ranking of each translation candidate t with respect to s and is assigned to be from 1 to k (number of output) in decreasing order of similarity measure</S>

        <P>
          <S ID="S-347916">direct (s,t) (or S CV direct(s,t)).</S>
          <S ID="S-347917">That is, if the similarity rankings of t are high in both of the context-vector and chi-square methods, it will be also ranked high in The direct translation process assumes that the retrieved search-result pages of a term exactly contain snippets from a certain region (e.g. Hong Kong) and written in the target language (e.g. traditional Chinese).</S>
          <S ID="S-347918">However, the assumption might not be reliable because the location (e.g. URL) of a Web page may not imply that it is written by the principle language used in that region.</S>
          <S ID="S-347919">Also, we cannot identify the language of a snippet simply using its character encoding scheme, because different regions may use the same character encoding schemes (e.g. Taiwan and Hong Kong mainly use the same traditional Chinese encoding scheme).</S>
          <S ID="S-347920">From previous work (<REF ID="R-17" RPTR="22">Tsou et al., 2004</REF>) we know that word entropies significantly reflect language differences in Hong Kong, Taiwan and China.</S>
          <S ID="S-347921">Herein, we propose another method for dealing with the above problem.</S>
          <S ID="S-347922">Since our goal is trying to eliminate the translation candidates {t j } that are not from the snippets in language l t , for each candidate t j we merge all of the snippets that contain t j into a document and then identify the corresponding language of t j based on the document.</S>
          <S ID="S-347923">We train a uni-gram language model for each language of concern and perform language identification based on a discrimination function, which locates maximum character or word entropy and is defined as:</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-347924">where N(t j ) is the collection of the snippets containing t j and L is a set of languages to be identified.</S>
          <S ID="S-347925">The candidate t j will be eliminated if lang &#8800;)( l t .</S>
          <S ID="S-347926">j t To examine the feasibility of the proposed method in identifying Chinese in Taiwan, mainland China and Hong Kong, we conducted a preliminary experiment.</S>
          <S ID="S-347927">To avoid the data sparseness of using a tri-gram language model, we simply use the above unigram model to perform language identification.</S>
          <S ID="S-347928">Even so, the experimental result has shown that very high identification accuracy can be achieved.</S>

          <S ID="S-347933">This allows us to collect regional training data for constructing language models.</S>
          <S ID="S-347934">In the task of translating English terms into traditional Chinese in Taiwan, the extracted candidates for &#8220;laser&#8221; contained &#8220; &#38647; &#23556; &#8221; (translation of laser mainly used in Taiwan) and &#8220; &#28608; &#20809; &#8221; (translation of laser mainly used in mainland China).</S>
          <S ID="S-347935">Based on the merged snippets, we found that &#8220; &#28608; &#20809; &#8221; had higher entropy value for the language model of mainland China while &#8220; &#38647; &#23556; &#8221; had higher entropy value for the language models of Taiwan and Hong Kong.</S>

          <S ID="S-347975">As the result in Table 4 shows, for the English-to-Japanese translation, the top-1, top-3, and top-5 inclusion rates were 35%, 52%, and 63%, respectively; for the English-to-Korean translation, the top-1, top-3, and top- 5 inclusion rates were 32%, 54%, and 63%, respectively, on average.</S>

          <S ID="S-347977">In this experiment, we first manually translated the collected data sets in English into traditional Chinese and then did the Chinese-to-Japanese/Korean translation via the third language English.</S>
          <S ID="S-347978">The results in Table 4 show that the propagation of translation errors reduced the translation accuracy.</S>
          <S ID="S-347979">For example, the inclusion rates of the Chinese-to- Japanese translation were lower than those of the English-to-Japanese translation since only 70%-86% inclusion rates were reached in the Chinese-to- English translation in the top 1-5.</S>
