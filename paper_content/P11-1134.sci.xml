    <A-S ID="S-33214">We experiment with a phrasal matching method in order to: i) build a system portable across languages, and ii) evaluate the contribution of lexical knowledge in isolation, without interaction with other inference mechanisms.</A-S>

      <HEADER>1 Introduction</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-33217">Cross-lingual Textual Entailment (CLTE) has been proposed by (<REF ID="R-18" RPTR="14">Mehdad et al., 2010</REF><REF ID="R-21" RPTR="23">Mehdad et al., 2010</REF>) as an extension of Textual Entailment (<REF ID="R-06" RPTR="4">Dagan and Glickman, 2004</REF>) that consists in deciding, given two texts T and H in different languages, if the meaning of H can be inferred from the meaning of T.</S>
        <S ID="S-33218">The task is inherently difficult, as it adds issues related to the multilingual dimension to the complexity of semantic inference at the textual level.</S>
        <S ID="S-33219">For instance, the reliance of current monolingual TE systems on lexical resources 1336</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-33220">(e.g. WordNet, VerbOcean, FrameNet) and deep processing components (e.g. syntactic and semantic parsers, co-reference resolution tools, temporal expressions recognizers and normalizers) has to confront, at the cross-lingual level, with the limited availability of lexical/semantic resources covering multiple languages, the limited coverage of the existing ones, and the burden of integrating languagespecific components into the same cross-lingual architecture.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-33221">As a first step to overcome these problems, (<REF ID="R-18" RPTR="15">Mehdad et al., 2010</REF><REF ID="R-21" RPTR="24">Mehdad et al., 2010</REF>) proposes a &#8220;basic solution&#8221;, that brings CLTE back to the monolingual scenario by translating H into the language of T.</S>
        <S ID="S-33222">Despite the advantages in terms of modularity and portability of the architecture, and the promising experimental results, this approach suffers from one main limitation which motivates the investigation on alternative solutions.</S>
        <S ID="S-33223">Decoupling machine translation (MT) and TE, in fact, ties CLTE performance to the availability of MT components, and to the quality of the translations.</S>
        <S ID="S-33224">As a consequence, on one side translation errors propagate to the TE engine hampering the entailment decision process.</S>
        <S ID="S-33225">On the other side such unpredictable errors reduce the possibility to control the behaviour of the engine, and devise adhoc solutions to specific entailment problems.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-33226">This paper investigates the idea, still unexplored, of a tighter integration of MT and TE algorithms and techniques.</S>
        <S ID="S-33227">Our aim is to embed cross-lingual processing techniques inside the TE recognition process in order to avoid any dependency on external MT components, and eventually gain full control of the system&#8217;s behaviour.</S>
        <S ID="S-33228">Along this direction, we</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-33229">start from the acquisition and use of lexical knowledge, which represents the basic building block of any TE system.</S>
        <S ID="S-33230">Using the basic solution proposed by (<REF ID="R-18" RPTR="16">Mehdad et al., 2010</REF><REF ID="R-21" RPTR="25">Mehdad et al., 2010</REF>) as a term of comparison, we experiment with different sources of multilingual lexical knowledge to address the following questions: (1) What is the potential of the existing multilingual lexical resources to approach CLTE?</S>
        <S ID="S-33231">To answer this question we experiment with lexical knowledge extracted from bilingual dictionaries, and from a multilingual lexical database.</S>
        <S ID="S-33232">Such experiments show two main limitations of these resources, namely: i) their limited coverage, and ii) the difficulty to capture contextual information when only associations between single words (or at most named entities and multiword expressions) are used to support inference.</S>
        <S ID="S-33233">(2) Does MT provide useful resources or techniques to overcome the limitations of existing resources?</S>
        <S ID="S-33234">We envisage several directions in which inputs from MT research may enable or improve CLTE.</S>
        <S ID="S-33235">As regards the resources, phrase and paraphrase tables extracted from bilingual parallel corpora can be exploited as an effective way to capture both lexical relations between single words, and contextual information useful for inference.</S>
        <S ID="S-33236">As regards the algorithms, statistical models based on cooccurrence observations, similar to those used in MT to estimate translation probabilities, may contribute to estimate entailment probabilities in CLTE.</S>
        <S ID="S-33237">Focusing on the resources direction, the main contribution of this paper is to show that the lexical knowledge extracted from parallel corpora allows to significantly improve the results achieved with other multilingual resources.</S>
        <S ID="S-33238">(3) In the cross-lingual scenario, can we achieve results comparable to those obtained in monolingual TE?</S>
        <S ID="S-33239">Our experiments show that, although CLTE seems intrinsically more difficult, the results obtained using phrase and paraphrase tables are better than those achieved by average systems on monolingual datasets.</S>
        <S ID="S-33240">We argue that this is due to the fact that parallel corpora are a rich source of crosslingual paraphrases with no equivalents in monolingual TE.</S>
        <S ID="S-33241">(4) Can parallel corpora be useful also for monolingual TE?</S>
        <S ID="S-33242">To answer this question, we experiment 1337</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-33243">on monolingual RTE datasets using paraphrase tables extracted from bilingual parallel corpora.</S>
        <S ID="S-33244">Our results improve those achieved with the most widely used resources in monolingual TE, namely Word- Net, Verbocean, and Wikipedia.</S>
        <S ID="S-33245">The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.</S>
        <S ID="S-33246">Section 2 shortly overviews the role of lexical knowledge in textual entailment, highlighting a gap between TE and CLTE in terms of available knowledge sources.</S>
        <S ID="S-33247">Sections 3 and 4 address the first three questions, giving motivations for the use of bilingual parallel corpora in CLTE, and showing the results of our experiments.</S>
        <S ID="S-33248">Section 5 addresses the last question, reporting on our experiments with paraphrase tables extracted from phrase tables on the monolingual RTE datasets.</S>
        <S ID="S-33249">Section 6 concludes the paper, and outlines the directions of our future research.</S>

      <HEADER>2 Lexical resources for TE and CLTE</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-33250">All current approaches to monolingual TE, either syntactically oriented (Rus et al., 2005), or applying logical inference (Tatu and <REF ID="R-30" RPTR="32">Moldovan, 2005</REF>), or adopting transformation-based techniques (<REF ID="R-16" RPTR="13">Kouleykov and Magnini, 2005</REF>; Bar-Haim et al., 2008), incorporate different types of lexical knowledge to support textual inference.</S>
        <S ID="S-33251">Such information ranges from i) lexical paraphrases (textual equivalences between terms) to ii) lexical relations preserving entailment between words, and iii) wordlevel similarity/relatedness scores.</S>
        <S ID="S-33252">WordNet, the most widely used resource in TE, provides all the three types of information.</S>
        <S ID="S-33253">Synonymy relations can be used to extract lexical paraphrases indicating that words from the text and the hypothesis entail each other, thus being interchangeable.</S>
        <S ID="S-33254">Hypernymy/hyponymy chains can provide entailmentpreserving relations between concepts, indicating that a word in the hypothesis can be replaced by a word from the text.</S>
        <S ID="S-33255">Paths between concepts and glosses can be used to calculate similarity/relatedness scores between single words, that contribute to the computation of the overall similarity between the text and the hypothesis.</S>
        <S ID="S-33256">Besides WordNet, the RTE literature documents the use of a variety of lexical information sources (Bentivogli et al., 2010; <REF ID="R-07" RPTR="5">Dagan et al., 2009</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-33257">These include, just to mention the most popular</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-33258">ones, DIRT (<REF ID="R-19" RPTR="21">Lin and Pantel, 2001</REF>), VerbOcean (<REF ID="R-05" RPTR="3">Chklovski and Pantel, 2004</REF>), FrameNet (<REF ID="R-00" RPTR="0">Baker et al., 1998</REF>), and Wikipedia (<REF ID="R-18" RPTR="17">Mehdad et al., 2010</REF><REF ID="R-21" RPTR="26">Mehdad et al., 2010</REF>; Kouylekov et al., 2009).</S>
        <S ID="S-33259">DIRT is a collection of statistically learned inference rules, that is often integrated as a source of lexical paraphrases and entailment rules.</S>
        <S ID="S-33260">VerbOcean is a graph of fine-grained semantic relations between verbs, which are frequently used as a source of precise entailment rules between predicates.</S>
        <S ID="S-33261">FrameNet is a knowledge-base of frames describing prototypical situations, and the role of the participants they involve.</S>
        <S ID="S-33262">It can be used as an alternative source of entailment rules, or to determine the semantic overlap between texts and hypotheses.</S>
        <S ID="S-33263">Wikipedia is often used to extract probabilistic entailment rules based word similarity/relatedness scores.</S>
        <S ID="S-33264">Despite the consensus on the usefulness of lexical knowledge for textual inference, determining the actual impact of these resources is not straightforward, as they always represent one component in complex architectures that may use them in different ways.</S>
        <S ID="S-33265">As emerges from the ablation tests reported in (Bentivogli et al., 2010), even the most common resources proved to have a positive impact on some systems and a negative impact on others.</S>
        <S ID="S-33266">Some previous works (<REF ID="R-01" RPTR="1">Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005</REF>; Zhao et al., 2009; Kouylekov et al., 2009) indicate, as main limitations of the mentioned resources, their limited coverage, their low precision, and the fact that they are mostly suitable to capture relations mainly between single words.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-33267">Addressing CLTE we have to face additional and more problematic issues related to: i) the stronger need of lexical knowledge, and ii) the limited availability of multilingual lexical resources.</S>
        <S ID="S-33268">As regards the first issue, it&#8217;s worth noting that in the monolingual scenario simple &#8220;bag of words&#8221; (or &#8220;bag of n- grams&#8221;) approaches are per se sufficient to achieve results above baseline.</S>
        <S ID="S-33269">In contrast, their application in the cross-lingual setting is not a viable solution due to the impossibility to perform direct lexical matches between texts and hypotheses in different languages.</S>
        <S ID="S-33270">This situation makes the availability of multilingual lexical knowledge a necessary condition to bridge the language gap.</S>
        <S ID="S-33271">However, with the only exceptions represented by WordNet and Wikipedia, most of the aforementioned resources 1338</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-33272">are available only for English.</S>
        <S ID="S-33273">Multilingual lexical databases aligned with the English WordNet (e.g. MultiWordNet (Pianta et al., 2002)) have been created for several languages, with different degrees of coverage.</S>
        <S ID="S-33274">As an example, the 57,424 synsets of the Spanish section of MultiWordNet aligned to English cover just around 50% of the WordNet&#8217;s synsets, thus making the coverage issue even more problematic than for TE.</S>
        <S ID="S-33275">As regards Wikipedia, the crosslingual links between pages in different languages offer a possibility to extract lexical knowledge useful for CLTE.</S>
        <S ID="S-33276">However, due to their relatively small number (especially for some languages), bilingual lexicons extracted from Wikipedia are still inadequate to provide acceptable coverage.</S>
        <S ID="S-33277">In addition, featuring a bias towards named entities, the information acquired through cross-lingual links can at most complement the lexical knowledge extracted from more generic multilingual resources (e.g bilingual dictionaries).</S>

      <HEADER>3 Using Parallel Corpora for CLTE</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-33314">Bilingual parallel corpora represent a possible solution to overcome the inadequacy of the existing resources, and to implement a portable approach for CLTE.</S>
        <S ID="S-33315">To this aim, we exploit parallel data to: i) learn alignment criteria between phrasal elements in different languages, ii) use them to automatically extract lexical knowledge in the form of phrase tables, and iii) use the obtained phrase tables to create monolingual paraphrase tables.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-33316">Given a cross-lingual T/H pair (with the text in l 1 and the hypothesis in l 2 ), our approach leverages the vast amount of lexical knowledge provided by phrase and paraphrase tables to map H into T.</S>
        <S ID="S-33317">We perform such mapping with two different methods.</S>
        <S ID="S-33318">The first method uses a single phrase table to directly map phrases extracted from the hypothesis to phrases in the text.</S>
        <S ID="S-33319">In order to improve our system&#8217;s generalization capabilities and increase the coverage, the second method combines the phrase table with two monolingual paraphrase tables (one in l 1 , and one in l 2 ).</S>
        <S ID="S-33320">This allows to:</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-33321">1. use the paraphrase table in l 2 to find paraphrases of phrases extracted from H;</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-33322">2. map them to entries in the phrase table, and extract their equivalents in l 1 ;</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-33323">3. use the paraphrase table in l 1 to find paraphrases of the extracted fragments in l 1 ;</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-33324">4. map such paraphrases to phrases in T.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-33325">With the second method, phrasal matches between the text and the hypothesis are indirectly performed through paraphrases of the phrase table entries.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-33326">The final entailment decision for a T/H pair is assigned considering a model learned from the similarity scores based on the identified phrasal matches.</S>
        <S ID="S-33327">In particular, &#8220;YES&#8221; and &#8220;NO&#8221; judgements are assigned considering the proportion of words in the hypothesis that are found also in the text.</S>
        <S ID="S-33328">This way to approximate entailment reflects the intuition that, as a directional relation between the text and the hypothesis, the full content of H has to be found in T.</S>

        <HEADER>3.1 Extracting Phrase and Paraphrase Tables</HEADER>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-33278">Phrase tables (PHT) contain pairs of corresponding phrases in two languages, together with association probabilities.</S>
          <S ID="S-33279">They are widely used in MT as a way to figure out how to translate input in one language into output in another language (<REF ID="R-14" RPTR="11">Koehn et al., 2003</REF>).</S>
          <S ID="S-33280">There are several methods to build phrase tables.</S>
          <S ID="S-33281">The one adopted in this work consists in learning phrase alignments from a word-aligned bilingual corpus.</S>
          <S ID="S-33282">In order to build English-Spanish phrase tables for our experiments, we used the freely available Europarl V.4, News Commentary and United Nations Spanish-English parallel corpora released for the WMT10 1 .</S>
          <S ID="S-33283">We run TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994) for tokenization, and used the Giza++ (<REF ID="R-25" RPTR="31">Och and Ney, 2003</REF>) to align the tokenized corpora at the word level.</S>
          <S ID="S-33284">Subsequently, we extracted the bilingual phrase table from the aligned corpora using the Moses toolkit (<REF ID="R-15" RPTR="12">Koehn et al., 2007</REF>).</S>
          <S ID="S-33285">Since the resulting phrase table was very large, we eliminated all the entries with identical content in the two languages, and the ones containing phrases longer than 5 words in one of the two sides.</S>
          <S ID="S-33286">In addition, in order to experiment with different phrase tables providing different degrees of coverage and precision, we extracted 7 phrase tables by pruning the initial one on the direct phrase translation probabilities of 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5.</S>
          <S ID="S-33287">The resulting phrase tables range from 76 to 48 million entries, with an average of 3.9 words per phrase.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-33288">Paraphrase tables (PPHT) contain pairs of corresponding phrases in the same language, possibly associated with probabilities.</S>
          <S ID="S-33289">They proved to be useful in a number of NLP applications such as natural language generation (<REF ID="R-12" RPTR="9">Iordanskaja et al., 1991</REF>), multidocument summarization (<REF ID="R-20" RPTR="22">McKeown et al., 2002</REF>), automatic evaluation of MT (<REF ID="R-08" RPTR="6">Denkowski and Lavie, 2010</REF>), and TE (<REF ID="R-09" RPTR="7">Dinu and Wang, 2009</REF>).</S>
          <S ID="S-33290">One of the proposed methods to extract paraphrases relies on a pivot-based approach using phrase alignments in a bilingual parallel corpus (<REF ID="R-01" RPTR="2">Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005</REF>).</S>
          <S ID="S-33291">With this method, all the different phrases in one language that are aligned with the same phrase in the other language are extracted as paraphrases.</S>
          <S ID="S-33292">After the extraction, pruning techniques (<REF ID="R-31" RPTR="33">Snover et al., 2009</REF>) can be applied to increase the precision of the extracted paraphrases.</S>

        <P>
          <S ID="S-33293">In our work we used available 2 paraphrase databases for English and Spanish which have been extracted using the method previously outlined.</S>

          <S ID="S-33360">Figure 1 shows that with the pruning threshold set to 0.05, we obtain the highest result of 62.62% on the test set.</S>
          <S ID="S-33361">The curve demonstrates that, although with higher pruning thresholds we retain more reliable phrase pairs, their smaller number provides limited coverage leading to lower results.</S>
          <S ID="S-33362">In contrast, the large coverage obtained with the pruning threshold set to 0.01 leads to a slight performance decrease due to probably less precise phrase pairs.</S>

          <S ID="S-33365">These results suggest that, with appropriate pruning thresholds, the large number and the longer entries contained in the phrase and paraphrase tables represent an effective way to: i) obtain high coverage, and ii) capture cross-lingual associations between multiple lexical elements.</S>

          <S ID="S-33368">This can be explained by the low coverage of MWN, whose entries also represent weaker semantic relations (preserving entailment, but with a lower probability to be applied) than the direct translations between terms contained in the dictionary.</S>

          <S ID="S-33389">It&#8217;s worth noting that these results, compared with the average scores reported by participants in the two editions of the RTE Challenge (AVG column), represent an accuracy improvement of more than 1%.</S>

          <S ID="S-33392">The comparison with the results achieved on monolingual data obtained by automatically translating the Spanish hypotheses (RTE3-G row in Table 2) leads to four main observations.</S>
          <S ID="S-33393">First, we notice that dealing with MT-derived inputs, the optimal pruning threshold changes from 0.2 to 0.1, leading to the highest accuracy of 63.50%.</S>
          <S ID="S-33394">This suggests that the noise introduced by incorrect translations can be tackled by increasing the coverage of the paraphrase table.</S>
          <S ID="S-33395">Second, in line with the findings of (<REF ID="R-18" RPTR="20">Mehdad et al., 2010</REF><REF ID="R-21" RPTR="29">Mehdad et al., 2010</REF>), the results obtained over the MT-derived corpus are equal to those we achieve over the original RTE3 dataset (i.e. 63.50%).</S>
          <S ID="S-33396">Third, the accuracy obtained over the CLTE corpus using combined phrase and paraphrase tables (62.88%, as reported in Table 1) is comparable to the best result gained over the automatically translated dataset (63.50%).</S>
          <S ID="S-33397">In all the other cases, the use of phrase and paraphrase tables on CLTE data outperforms the results achieved on the same data after translation.</S>
          <S ID="S-33398">Finally, it&#8217;s worth remarking that applying our phrase matching method on the translated dataset without any additional source of knowledge would result in an overall accuracy of 62.12%, which is lower than the result obtained using only phrase tables on cross-lingual data (62.62%).</S>
          <S ID="S-33399">This demonstrates that phrase tables can successfully replace MT systems in the CLTE task.</S>
          <S ID="S-33400">In light of this, we suggest that extracting lexical knowledge from parallel corpora is a preferable solution to approach CLTE.</S>
          <S ID="S-33401">One of the main reasons is that placing a black-box MT system at the front-end of the entailment process reduces the possibility to cope with wrong translations.</S>
          <S ID="S-33402">Furthermore, the access to MT components is not easy (e.g. Google Translate limits the number and the size of queries, while open source MT tools cover few language pairs).</S>
          <S ID="S-33403">Moreover, the task of developing a full-fledged MT system often requires the availability of parallel corpora, and is much more complex than extracting lexical knowledge from them.</S>

      <HEADER>6 Conclusion and Future Work</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-33409">In this paper we approached the cross-lingual Textual Entailment task focusing on the role of lexical knowledge extracted from bilingual parallel corpora.</S>
        <S ID="S-33410">One of the main difficulties in CLTE raises from the lack of adequate knowledge resources to bridge the lexical gap between texts and hypotheses in different languages.</S>
        <S ID="S-33411">Our approach builds on the intuition that the vast amount of knowledge that can be extracted from parallel data (in the form of phrase and paraphrase tables) offers a possible solution to the problem.</S>
        <S ID="S-33412">To check the validity of our assumptions we carried out several experiments on an English-Spanish corpus derived from the RTE3 dataset, using phrasal matches as a criterion to approximate entailment.</S>
        <S ID="S-33413">Our results show that phrase and paraphrase tables allow to: i) outperform the results achieved with the few multilingual lexical resources available, and ii) reach performance levels above the average scores obtained by participants in the monolingual RTE3 challenge.</S>
        <S ID="S-33414">These improvements can be explained by the fact that the lexical knowledge extracted from parallel data provides good coverage both at the level of single words, and at the level of phrases.</S>
        <S ID="S-33415">As a further contribution, we explored the application of paraphrase tables extracted from parallel data in the traditional monolingual scenario.</S>
        <S ID="S-33416">Contrasting results with those obtained with the most widely used resources in TE, we demonstrated the effectiveness of paraphrase tables as a mean to overcome the bias towards single words featured by the existing resources.</S>
        <S ID="S-33417">Our future work will address both the extraction of lexical information from bilingual parallel corpora, and its use for TE and CLTE.</S>
        <S ID="S-33418">On one side, we plan to explore alternative ways to build phrase and paraphrase tables.</S>
        <S ID="S-33419">One possible direction is to consider linguistically motivated approaches, such as the extraction of syntactic phrase tables as proposed by (<REF ID="R-34" RPTR="34">Yamada and Knight, 2001</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-33420">Another interesting direction is to investigate the potential of paraphrase patterns (i.e. patterns including partof-speech slots), extracted from bilingual parallel corpora with the method proposed by (Zhao et al., 2009).</S>
        <S ID="S-33421">On the other side we will investigate more sophisticated methods to exploit the acquired lexical knowledge.</S>
        <S ID="S-33422">As a first step, the probability scores assigned to phrasal entries will be considered to perform weighted phrase matching as an improved criterion to approximate entailment.</S>
