  <ABSTRACT>
    <A-S ID="S-52666">There has been a recent surge of interest in semantic machine translation, which standard automatic metrics struggle to evaluate.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-52667">A family of measures called MEANT has been proposed which uses semantic role labels (SRL) to overcome this problem.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-52668">The human variant, HMEANT, has largely been evaluated using correlation with human contrastive evaluations, the standard human evaluation metric for the WMT shared tasks.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-52669">In this paper we claim that for a human metric to be useful, it needs to be evaluated on intrinsic properties.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-52670">It needs to be reliable; it needs to work across different language pairs; and it needs to be lightweight.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-52671">Most importantly, however, a human metric must be discerning.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-52672">We conclude that HMEANT is a step in the right direction, but has some serious flaws.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-52673">The reliance on verbs as heads of frames, and the assumption that annotators need minimal guidelines are particularly problematic.</A-S>

      <P>
        <S ID="S-52674">Human evaluation is essential in machine translation (MT) research because it is the ultimate way to judge system quality.</S>
        <S ID="S-52675">Furthermore, human evaluation is used to evaluate automatic metrics which are necessary for tuning system parameters.</S>
        <S ID="S-52676">Unfortunately, there is no clear consensus on which evaluation strategy is best.</S>
        <S ID="S-52677">Humans have been asked to judge if translations are correct, to grade them and to rank them.</S>
        <S ID="S-52678">But it is often very difficult to decide how good a translation is, when there are so many possible ways of translating a sentence.</S>
        <S ID="S-52679">Another problem is that different types of evaluation might be useful for different purposes.</S>
        <S ID="S-52680">If the MT is going to be the basis of a human translator&#8217;s work-flow, then post-editing effort seems like a natural fit.</S>
        <S ID="S-52681">However, for people using MT for gisting, what we really want is some measure of how much meaning has been retained.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-52682">We clearly need a metric which tries to answer the question, how much of the meaning does the translation capture.</S>
        <S ID="S-52683">In this paper, we explore the use of human evaluation metrics which attempt to capture the extent of this meaning retention.</S>
        <S ID="S-52684">In particular, we consider HMEANT (<REF ID="R-15" RPTR="23">Lo and Wu, 2011</REF><REF ID="R-16" RPTR="29">Lo and Wu, 2011</REF>a), a metric that uses semantic role labels to measure how much of the &#8220;who, why, when, where&#8221; has been preserved.</S>
        <S ID="S-52685">For HMEANT evaluation, annotators are instructed to identify verbs as heads of semantic frames.</S>
        <S ID="S-52686">Then they attach role fillers to the heads and finally they align heads and role fillers in the candidate translation with those in a reference translation.</S>
        <S ID="S-52687">In a series of papers, <REF ID="R-14" RPTR="18">Lo and Wu (2010</REF>, 2011b,a, 2012) explored a number of questions, evaluating HMEANT by using correlation statistics to compare it to judgements of human adequacy and contrastive evaluations.</S>
        <S ID="S-52688">Given the drawbacks of those evaluation measures, which we discuss in Sec.</S>
        <S ID="S-52689">2, they could just as well have been evaluating the human adequacy and contrastive judgements using HMEANT.</S>
        <S ID="S-52690">Human evaluation metrics need to be judged on other intrinsic qualities, which we describe below.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-52691">The aim of this paper is to evaluate the effectiveness of HMEANT, with the goal of using it to judge the relative merits of different MT systems, for example in the shared task of the Workshop on Machine Translation.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-52692">In order to be useful, an MT evaluation metric must be reliable, be language independent, have discriminatory power, and be efficient.</S>
        <S ID="S-52693">We address each of these criteria as follows:</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-52694">Reliability We produce extensive IAA (Interannotator agreement) for HMEANT, breaking it down into the different stages of annotation.</S>

      <P>
        <S ID="S-52697">the annotation, the compounding effect of disagreement at each stage of the pipeline greatly reduces the effective overall IAA &#8212; to 0.44 on role alignment for German, and, only slightly better, 0.59 for English.</S>
        <S ID="S-52698">This raises doubts about the reliability of HMEANT in its current form.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-52699">Discriminatory Power We consider output of three types of MT system (Phrase-based, Syntaxbased and Rule-based) to attempt to gain insight into the different types of semantic information preserved by the different systems.</S>
        <S ID="S-52700">The Syntaxbased system seems to have a slight edge overall, but since IAA is so low, this result has to be taken with a grain of salt.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-52701">Language Independence We apply HMEANT to both English and German translation outputs, showing that the guidelines can be adapted to the new language.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-52702">Efficiency Whilst HMEANT evaluation will never be as fast as, for example, the contrastive judgements used for the WMT shared task, it is still reasonably efficient considering the fine-grained nature of the evaluation.</S>
        <S ID="S-52703">On average, annotators evaluated about 10 sentences per hour.</S>

        <S ID="S-52704">Even though the idea that machine translation requires a semantic representation of the translated content is as old as the idea of computer-based translation itself (<REF ID="R-26" RPTR="42">Weaver, 1955</REF>), it has not been until recently that people have begun to combine statistical models with semantic representations.</S>
        <S ID="S-52705"><REF ID="R-09" RPTR="13">Jones et al. (2012)</REF>, for example, represent meaning as directed acyclic graphs and map these to PropBank (<REF ID="R-20" RPTR="34">Palmer et al., 2005</REF>) style dependencies.</S>
        <S ID="S-52706">To evaluate such approaches properly, we need evaluation metrics that capture the accuracy of the translation.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-52707">Current automatic metrics of machine translation, such as BLEU (<REF ID="R-21" RPTR="35">Papineni et al., 2002</REF>), METEOR (<REF ID="R-11" RPTR="15">Lavie and Denkowski, 2009</REF>) and TER (<REF ID="R-23" RPTR="37">Snover et al., 2009</REF><REF ID="R-24" RPTR="39">Snover et al., 2009</REF>b), which have greatly accelerated progress in MT research, rely on shallow surface properties of the translations, and only indirectly capture whether or not the translation preserves the meaning.</S>
        <S ID="S-52708">This has meant that potentially more sophisticated translation models are pitted against the flatter phrase-based models, based on metrics which cannot reflect their strengths.</S>
        <S ID="S-52709"><REF ID="R-04" RPTR="8">Callison-Burch et al. (2011)</REF> provide evidence that automatic metrics are inconsistent with human judgements when comparing rule-based against statistical machine translation systems.</S>

        <S ID="S-52710">Automatic evaluation metrics are evaluated and calibrated based on their correlation with human judgements.</S>
        <S ID="S-52711">However, after more than 60 years of research into machine translation, there is still no consensus on how to evaluate machine translation based on human judgements.</S>
        <S ID="S-52712">(<REF ID="R-08" RPTR="12">Hutchins and Somers, 1992</REF>; <REF ID="R-22" RPTR="36">Przybocki et al., 2009</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-52713">One obvious approach is to ask annotators to rate translation candidates on a numerical scale.</S>
        <S ID="S-52714">Under the DARPA TIDES program, the Linguistic Data <REF ID="R-12" RPTR="16">Consortium (2002)</REF> developed an evaluation scheme that relies on two five-point scales representing fluency and adequacy.</S>
        <S ID="S-52715">This was also the human evaluation scheme used in the annual MT competitions sponsored by <REF ID="R-19" RPTR="33">NIST (2005)</REF>.</S>
        <S ID="S-52716">In an analysis of human evaluation results for the WMT &#8217;07 workshop, however, <REF ID="R-03" RPTR="6">Callison-Burch et al. (2007)</REF> found high correlation between fluency and adequacy scores assigned by individual annotators, suggesting that human annotators are not able to separate these two evaluation dimensions easily.</S>
        <S ID="S-52717">Furthermore these absolute scores show low inter-annotator agreement.</S>
        <S ID="S-52718">Instead of giving absolute quality assessments, annotators appeared to be using their ratings to rank translation candidates according to their overall preference for one over the other.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-52719">In line with these findings, <REF ID="R-03" RPTR="7">Callison-Burch et al. (2007)</REF> proposed to let annotators rank translation candidates directly, without asking them to assign an absolute quality assessment to each candidate.</S>
        <S ID="S-52720">This type of human evaluation has been performed in the last six Workshops on Statistical Machine Translation.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-52721">Although it is useful to have a score or a rank for a particular sentence, especially for evaluating automatic metrics, these ratings are necessarily a simplification of the real differences between translations.</S>
        <S ID="S-52722">Translations can contain a large number of different types of errors of varying severity.</S>
        <S ID="S-52723">Even if we put aside difficulties with selecting one preferred sentence, ranking judgements are difficult to generalise.</S>
        <S ID="S-52724">Humans are shown five translations at a time, and there is a high cognitive cost to ranking these at once.</S>

        <S ID="S-52727">The methodology for interpreting the contrastive evaluations has been the subject of much recent debate in the community (<REF ID="R-01" RPTR="0">Bojar et al., 2011</REF>; <REF ID="R-18" RPTR="32">Lopez, 2012</REF>).</S>

        <S ID="S-52730">This type of evaluation is of some use when one is using MT to aid human translation (although the relationship between number of edits and actual effort is not straightforward (<REF ID="R-10" RPTR="14">Koponen, 2012</REF>)), but it is not so helpful when one&#8217;s task is gisting.</S>
        <S ID="S-52731">The number of edits need not correlate with the severity of the semantic differences between the two sentences.</S>
        <S ID="S-52732">The loss of a negative, for instance, is only one edit away from the original, but the semantics change completely.</S>

        <S ID="S-52733">Alternatively, HyTER (<REF ID="R-05" RPTR="9">Dreyer and Marcu, 2012</REF>) is an annotation tool which allows a user to create an exponential number of correct translations for a given sentence.</S>
        <S ID="S-52734">These references are then efficiently exploited to compare with machine translation output.</S>
        <S ID="S-52735">The authors argue that the current metrics fail simply because they have access to sets of reference translations which are simply too small.</S>
        <S ID="S-52736">However, the fact is that even if one does have access to large numbers of translations, it is very difficult to determine whether the reference correctly captures the essential semantic content of the references.</S>

        <P>
          <S ID="S-52796">The annotation for English was performed by 3 different annotators (E1, E2 and E3), and the German annotation by 2 annotators (D1 and D2).</S>
          <S ID="S-52797">All the English annotators were machine translation researchers, with E1 and E2 both native English speakers whereas E3 is not a native speaker, but lives and works in an English-speaking country.</S>
          <S ID="S-52798">The two German annotators were both native speakers of German, with no background in computational linguistics, although D2 is a teacher of German as a second language and has had linguistic training.</S>
          <S ID="S-52799">The HMEANT evaluation task was carried out following the framework described in <REF ID="R-15" RPTR="20">Lo and Wu (2011</REF><REF ID="R-16" RPTR="26">Lo and Wu (2011</REF>a) and <REF ID="R-02" RPTR="2">Bojar and Wu (2012)</REF>.</S>
          <S ID="S-52800">For each sentence in the evaluation set, the annotators were first asked to mark the semantic frames and roles (i.e., slot fillers within the frame) in a human reference translation of the respective sentence.</S>
          <S ID="S-52801">They were then presented with the output of several machine translation systems for the same source sentence, one system at a time, with the reference translation and its annotations visible in the left half of the screen (cf. Fig.</S>
          <S ID="S-52802">1).</S>
          <S ID="S-52803">For each system, the annotators were asked to annotate semantic frames and slot fillers in the translation first, and then align them with frame heads and slot fillers in the human reference translation.</S>
          <S ID="S-52804">Annotations and alignment were performed with Edi-HMEANT 2 , a web-based annotation tool for HMEANT that we developed on the basis of Yawat (<REF ID="R-06" RPTR="10">Germann, 2008</REF>).</S>
          <S ID="S-52805">The tool allows the alignment of slots from different semantic frames, and the alignment of slots of different types; however, such alignments are not considered in the computation of the final HMEANT score.</S>
          <S ID="S-52806">The annotation guidelines were essentially those used in <REF ID="R-02" RPTR="3">Bojar and Wu (2012)</REF>, with some additional English examples, and a complete set of German examples.</S>
          <S ID="S-52807">For ease of comparison with prior work, we used the same set of semantic role labels as <REF ID="R-02" RPTR="4">Bojar and Wu (2012)</REF>, shown in Table 1.</S>
          <S ID="S-52808">Given the restriction that the head of a frame can consist of only one word, a convention was made that all other verbs attached to the main verb such as modals, auxiliaries or separable particles for German verbs, would be labelled as modal.</S>

        <HEADER>5.1 Inter-Annotator Agreement</HEADER>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-52812">We first measured IAA on role identification, as in <REF ID="R-15" RPTR="21">Lo and Wu (2011</REF><REF ID="R-16" RPTR="27">Lo and Wu (2011</REF>a), except that we use exact match on word spans as opposed to the approximate match employed in that reference.</S>
          <S ID="S-52813">Whilst exact match is a harsher measure, penalising disagreements related to punctuation and articles, using any sort of approximate match would mean having to deal with N:M matches.</S>
          <S ID="S-52814">IAA is defined as follows:</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-52815">IAA = 2 &#8727; P &#8727; R P + R</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-52816">Where P is defined as the number of labels (either heads, roles, or alignments) that match between annotators, divided by the total number of labels given by annotator 1.</S>
          <S ID="S-52817">And R is defined the same way for annotator 2.</S>
          <S ID="S-52818">This is similar to an F-measure (f1), where we consider one of the annotators as the gold standard.</S>
          <S ID="S-52819">The IAA for role identification is shown in Table 3.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-52820">The agreements in Table 3 are not too different from those reported in earlier work.</S>
          <S ID="S-52821">We note that the IAA for the German annotators drops for the MT system outputs, but this may be because the English annotators (as MT researchers) are less bothered by bad MT output than their counterparts working on the German texts.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-52822">Next we looked at the IAA on role classification, the other IAA figure provided by <REF ID="R-15" RPTR="22">Lo and Wu (2011</REF><REF ID="R-16" RPTR="28">Lo and Wu (2011</REF>a).</S>
          <S ID="S-52823">We only considered roles where both annotators had marked the same span in the same frame, with the frame being identified by its action.</S>
          <S ID="S-52824">The IAA for role classification is shown in Table 4.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-52825">Again, we show similar levels of IAA to those reported in (<REF ID="R-15" RPTR="24">Lo and Wu, 2011</REF><REF ID="R-16" RPTR="30">Lo and Wu, 2011</REF>a).</S>
          <S ID="S-52826">Examining the disagreements in more detail, we produced counts of the most common role type disagreements, by</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-52827">language.</S>
          <S ID="S-52828">We show the top 5 disagreements in Tables 5 and 6.</S>
          <S ID="S-52829">Essentially these show that the most common role types provide the most confusions.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-52830">In order to shed more light on the role type disagreements, we examined a random sample of 10 of the English annotations where the annotators had disagreed about &#8220;Agent&#8221; versus &#8220;Experiencer- Patient&#8221;.</S>
          <S ID="S-52831">In 7 of these cases, there was a definite correct answer, according to the annotation guidelines.</S>
          <S ID="S-52832">Of the other 3, there were 2 cases of poor MT output making the semantic interpretation difficult, and one case of existential &#8220;there&#8221;.</S>
          <S ID="S-52833">Of the 7 cases where one annotator appears in error, 3 were passive, 1 was a copula, and 1 involved the verb</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-52834">&#8220;receive&#8221;.</S>
          <S ID="S-52835">For the other 2 there was no clear reason for the error.</S>
          <S ID="S-52836">From this small sample, we suggest that passive constructions are still difficult to annotate semantically.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-52837">The last of elements of the semantic frames to be considered for IAA are the actions, i.e. the frame heads or predicates.</S>
          <S ID="S-52838">In this case identifying a match was straightforward as actions are identified by a single token.</S>
          <S ID="S-52839">The IAA for action identification is shown in Table 7.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-52840">We see fairly high IAA for actions, which seems encouraging, but given the importance of actions in HMEANT, we probably need the scores to be higher.</S>
          <S ID="S-52841">Most of the problems with the identification of actions centre around multiple-verb constructions and participles.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-52842">We now turn our attention to the second stage of the annotation process where the annotators marked alignments between slots and roles.</S>
          <S ID="S-52843">These provide the relevant statistics for the calculation of the HMEANT score so it is important that they are annotated reliably.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-52844">Firstly, we consider the alignment of actions.</S>
          <S ID="S-52845">In this case, we use pipelined statistics, in that if one annotator marks actions in the reference and hypothesis, then aligns them, whilst the other annotator does not mark the corresponding actions, we still count this as an action alignment mismatch.</S>
          <S ID="S-52846">This creates a harsher measure on action alignment, but gives a better idea of the overall reliability of the annotation task.</S>
          <S ID="S-52847">In Table 8 we show the IAA (as F1) on action alignments.</S>
          <S ID="S-52848">Comparing Tables 8 and 7 we see that, for English at least, the</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-52849">agreement on action alignment is not much lower than that on action identification, indicating that if annotators agree on the actions then they generally agree on how they align.</S>
          <S ID="S-52850">For German, however, the IAA on action alignment is a bit lower, apparently because one of the annotators was much stricter about which actions they aligned.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-52851">In order to calculate the IAA on role alignments, we only consider those alignments that connect two roles in aligned frames, of the same type, since these are the only role alignments that count for computing the HMEANT score.</S>
          <S ID="S-52852">This means that if one of the annotators does not align the frames, then all the contained role alignments are counted as mismatches.</S>
          <S ID="S-52853">We do not consider the spans when calculating the agreement on role alignments, meaning that if one annotator has an alignment between roles of type T in frame F , and the other annotator also aligns the same types of roles in the same frame, then they are considered as a match.</S>
          <S ID="S-52854">This is done because it is only the counts of alignments that are relevant for HMEANT scoring.</S>
          <S ID="S-52855">The IAA on the role alignments is quite</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-52856">low, dipping below 0.5 for German.</S>
          <S ID="S-52857">This is mainly because of the pipelining effect, where annotation disagreements at each stage are compounded.</S>
          <S ID="S-52858">Since the final HMEANT score is computed essentially by counting role alignments, this level of IAA causes problems for this score calculation.</S>

          <S ID="S-52879">The fact that the final role IAA, in Table 9, is 0.442 for German and 0.596 for English, demonstrates that there are fundamental problems with the scheme.</S>
          <S ID="S-52880">One of the areas of greatest confusion is between what seems like one of the easiest role types to distinguish: agent and patient.</S>
          <S ID="S-52881">Here is an example of a passive where one annotator has marked &#8220;tea&#8221; wrongly as agent, and the other annotator correctly labelled it as patient:</S>

          <S ID="S-52885"><REF ID="R-02" RPTR="5">Bojar and Wu (2012)</REF> listed a number of problems and improvements to HMEANT, which we largely agree with.</S>

        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-52889">&#8226; Heads being limited to verbs The semantics of verbs can often be carried by an equivalent noun and should be allowed by HMEANT.</S>
          <S ID="S-52890">For example &#8220;My father broke down and cried .&#8221;, the verb &#8220;cried&#8221; is correctly paraphrased in &#8220;My father collapsed in tears .&#8221;</S>

          <S ID="S-52893">&#8226; Prepositional Phrases attaching to a noun These can greatly affect the semantics of a sentence, but HMEANT has no way of capturing this.</S>

          <S ID="S-52899">The patient role of the verb &#8220;said&#8221; could be aligned as correct, as the error is already captured in relation to the verb &#8220;suffocates&#8221;.</S>
