  <ABSTRACT>
    <A-S ID="S-12537">We propose a novel, language-independent approach for improving machine translation from a resource-poor language to X by adapting a large bi-text for a related resource-rich language and X (the same target language).</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-12538">We assume a small bi-text for the resourcepoor language to X pair, which we use to learn word-level and phrase-level paraphrases and cross-lingual morphological variants between the resource-rich and the resource-poor language; we then adapt the former to get closer to the latter.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-12539">Our experiments for Indonesian/Malay&#8211;English translation show that using the large adapted resource-rich bitext yields 6.7 BLEU points of improvement over the unadapted one and 2.6 BLEU points over the original small bi-text.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-12540">Moreover, combining the small bi-text with the adapted bi-text outperforms the corresponding combinations with the unadapted bi-text by 1.5&#8211; 3 BLEU points.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-12541">We also demonstrate applicability to other languages and domains.</A-S>

      <P>
        <S ID="S-12542">Statistical machine translation (SMT) systems learn how to translate from large sentence-aligned bilingual corpora of human-generated translations, called bi-texts.</S>
        <S ID="S-12543">Unfortunately, collecting sufficiently large, high-quality bi-texts is hard, and thus most of the 6,500+ world languages remain resource-poor.</S>
        <S ID="S-12544">Fortunately, many of these resource-poor languages are related to some resource-rich language, with whom they overlap in vocabulary and share cognates, which offers opportunities for bi-text reuse.</S>
        <S ID="S-12545">Example pairs of such resource rich&#8211;poor languages include Spanish&#8211;Catalan, Finnish&#8211;Estonian, Swedish&#8211;Norwegian, Russian&#8211;Ukrainian, Irish&#8211; Gaelic Scottish, Standard German&#8211;Swiss German, Modern Standard Arabic&#8211;Dialectical Arabic (e.g., Gulf, Egyptian), Turkish&#8211;Azerbaijani, etc.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-12546">Previous work has already demonstrated the benefits of using a bi-text for a related resource-rich language to X (e.g., X=English) to improve machine translation from a resource-poor language to X (<REF ID="R-12" RPTR="12">Nakov and Ng, 2009</REF>; <REF ID="R-14" RPTR="17">Nakov and Ng, 2012</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-12547">Here we take a different, orthogonal approach: we adapt the resource-rich language to get closer to the resource-poor one.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-12548">We assume a small bi-text for the resource-poor language, which we use to learn word-level and phrase-level paraphrases and cross-lingual morphological variants between the two languages.</S>
        <S ID="S-12549">Assuming translation into the same target language X, we adapt (the source side of) a large training bi-text for a related resource-rich language and X.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-12550">Training on the adapted large bi-text yields very significant improvements in translation quality compared to both (a) training on the unadapted version, and (b) training on the small bi-text for the resourcepoor language.</S>
        <S ID="S-12551">We further achieve very sizable improvements when combining the small bi-text with the large adapted bi-text, compared to combining the former with the unadapted bi-text.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-12552">While we focus on adapting Malay to look like Indonesian in our experiments, we also demonstrate the applicability of our approach to another language pair, Bulgarian&#8211;Macedonian, which is also from a different domain.</S>

      <HEADER>2 Related Work</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-12553">One relevant line of research is on machine translation between closely related languages, which is arguably simpler than general SMT, and thus can be handled using word-for-word translation, manual language-specific rules that take care of the necessary morphological and syntactic transformations, or character-level translation/transliteration.</S>
        <S ID="S-12554">This has been tried for a number of language pairs including Czech&#8211;Slovak (<REF ID="R-08" RPTR="8">Haji&#269; et al., 2000</REF>), Turkish&#8211; Crimean Tatar (<REF ID="R-00" RPTR="0">Altintas and Cicekli, 2002</REF>), Irish&#8211; Scottish Gaelic (<REF ID="R-20" RPTR="26">Scannell, 2006</REF>), and Bulgarian&#8211; Macedonian (<REF ID="R-15" RPTR="21">Nakov and Tiedemann, 2012</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-12555">In contrast, we have a different objective &#8211; we do not carry out full translation but rather adaptation since our ultimate goal is to translate into a third language X.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-12556">A special case of this same line of research is the translation between dialects of the same language, e.g., between Cantonese and Mandarin (Zhang, 1998), or between a dialect of a language and a standard version of that language, e.g., between some Arabic dialect (e.g., Egyptian) and Modern Standard Arabic (<REF ID="R-02" RPTR="2">Bakr et al., 2008</REF>; <REF ID="R-19" RPTR="25">Sawaf, 2010</REF>; <REF ID="R-18" RPTR="24">Salloum and Habash, 2011</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-12557">Here again, manual rules and/or language-specific tools are typically used.</S>
        <S ID="S-12558">In the case of Arabic dialects, a further complication arises by the informal status of the dialects, which are not standardized and not used in formal contexts but rather only in informal online communities 1 such as social networks, chats, Twitter and SMS messages.</S>
        <S ID="S-12559">This causes further mismatch in domain and genre.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-12560">Thus, translating from Arabic dialects to Modern Standard Arabic requires, among other things, normalizing informal text to a formal form.</S>
        <S ID="S-12561">In fact, this is a more general problem, which arises with informal sources like SMS messages and Tweets for just any language (<REF ID="R-01" RPTR="1">Aw et al., 2006</REF>; <REF ID="R-09" RPTR="9">Han and Baldwin, 2011</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-12562">Here the main focus is on coping with spelling errors, abbreviations, and slang, which are typically addressed using string edit distance, while also taking pronunciation into account.</S>
        <S ID="S-12563">This is different from our task, where we try to adapt good, formal text from one language into another.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-12564">A second relevant line of research is on language adaptation and normalization, when done specifically for improving SMT into another language.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-12565">1 The Egyptian Wikipedia is one notable exception.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-12566">For example, <REF ID="R-11" RPTR="11">Marujo et al. (2011)</REF> described a rule-based system for adapting Brazilian Portuguese (BP) to European Portuguese (EP), which they used to adapt BP&#8211;English bi-texts to EP&#8211;English.</S>
        <S ID="S-12567">They report small improvements in BLEU for EP&#8211;English translation when training on the adapted &#8220;EP&#8221;&#8211;En bi-text compared to using the unadapted BP&#8211;En (38.55 vs. 38.29), or when an EP&#8211;English bi-text is used in addition to the adapted/unadapted one (41.07 vs. 40.91 BLEU).</S>
        <S ID="S-12568">Unlike this work, which heavily relied on language-specific rules, our approach is statistical, and largely language-independent; moreover, our improvements are much more sizable.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-12569">A third relevant line of research is on reusing bitexts between related languages without or with very little adaptation, which works well for very closely related languages.</S>
        <S ID="S-12570">For example, our previous work (<REF ID="R-12" RPTR="13">Nakov and Ng, 2009</REF>; <REF ID="R-14" RPTR="18">Nakov and Ng, 2012</REF>) experimented with various techniques for combining a small bi-text for a resource-poor language (Indonesian or Spanish, pretending that Spanish is resource-poor) with a much larger bi-text for a related resource-rich language (Malay or Portuguese); the target language of all bi-texts was English.</S>
        <S ID="S-12571">However, our previous work did not attempt language adaptation, except for very simple transliteration for Portuguese&#8211;Spanish that ignored context entirely; since it could not substitute one word for a completely different word, it did not help much for Malay&#8211;Indonesian, which use unified spelling.</S>
        <S ID="S-12572">Still, once we have language-adapted the large bi-text, it makes sense to try to combine it further with the small bi-text; thus, below we will directly compare and combine these two approaches.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-12573">Another alternative, which we do not explore in this work, is to use cascaded translation using a pivot language (<REF ID="R-22" RPTR="28">Utiyama and Isahara, 2007</REF>; <REF ID="R-06" RPTR="6">Cohn and Lapata, 2007</REF>; <REF ID="R-23" RPTR="29">Wu and Wang, 2009</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-12574">Unfortunately, using the resource-rich language as a pivot (poor&#8594;rich&#8594;X) would require an additional parallel poor&#8211;rich bi-text, which we do not have.</S>
        <S ID="S-12575">Pivoting over the target X (rich&#8594;X&#8594;poor) for the purpose of language adaptation, on the other hand, would miss the opportunity to exploit the relationship between the resource-poor and the resource-rich language; this would also be circular since the first step would ask an SMT system to translate its own training data (we only have one rich&#8211;X bi-text).</S>

        <S ID="S-12581">(Indonesian) There is only 50% overlap at the word level, but the actual vocabulary overlap is much higher, e.g., there is only one word in the Malay text that does not exist in Indonesian: samarata (&#8216;equal&#8217;).</S>
        <S ID="S-12582">Other differences are due to the use of different morphological forms, e.g., hendaklah vs. hendaknya (&#8216;conscience&#8217;), derivational variants of hendak (&#8216;want&#8217;).</S>
        <S ID="S-12583">Of course, word choice in translation is often a matter of taste.</S>
        <S ID="S-12584">Thus, we asked a native speaker of Indonesian to adapt the Malay version to Indonesian while preserving as many words as possible:</S>

        <P>
          <S ID="S-12595">Given a Malay sentence, we generate a confusion network containing multiple Indonesian word-level paraphrase options for each Malay word.</S>
          <S ID="S-12596">Each such Indonesian option is associated with a corresponding weight in the network, which is defined as the probability of this option being a translation of the original Malay word (see Eq.</S>
          <S ID="S-12597">1 below).</S>
          <S ID="S-12598">We decode this confusion network using a large Indonesian language model, thus generating a ranked list of n corresponding adapted &#8220;Indonesian&#8221; sentences.</S>
          <S ID="S-12599">Then, we pair each such adapted &#8220;Indonesian&#8221; sentence with the English counter-part for the Malay sentence it was derived from, thus obtaining a synthetic &#8220;Indonesian&#8221;&#8211;English bi-text.</S>
          <S ID="S-12600">Finally, we combine this synthetic bi-text with the original Indonesian&#8211;English one to train the final Indonesian&#8211;English SMT system.</S>
          <S ID="S-12601">Below we first describe how we generate wordlevel Indonesian options and corresponding weights for the Malay words.</S>
          <S ID="S-12602">Then, we explain how we build, decode, and improve the confusion network.</S>
          <S ID="S-12603">3 There are other potentially useful operations, e.g., a correct translation for the Malay samarata can be obtained by splitting it into the Indonesian sequence sama rata.</S>

          <S ID="S-12605">288 4.1.1 Inducing Word-Level Paraphrases We use pivoting over English to induce potential Indonesian translations for a given Malay word.</S>
          <S ID="S-12606">First, we generate separate word-level alignments for the Indonesian&#8211;English and the Malay&#8211;English bi-texts.</S>
          <S ID="S-12607">Then, we induce Indonesian-Malay word translation pairs assuming that if an Indonesian word i and a Malay word m are aligned to the same English word e, they could be mutual translations.</S>
          <S ID="S-12608">Each translation pair is associated with a conditional probability, estimated by pivoting over English:</S>
        </P>

          <S ID="S-12609">likelihood from the word alignments.</S>
          <S ID="S-12610">Following (<REF ID="R-05" RPTR="5">Callison-Burch et al., 2006</REF>), we further assume that i is conditionally independent of m given e.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-12611">Given a Malay sentence, we construct an Indonesian confusion network, where each Malay word is augmented with a set of network transitions: possible Indonesian word translations.</S>
          <S ID="S-12612">The weight of such a transition is the conditional Indonesian- Malay translation probability as calculated by Eq.</S>
          <S ID="S-12613">1; the original Malay word is assigned a weight of 1.</S>
          <S ID="S-12614">Note that we paraphrase each word in the input Malay sentence as opposed to only those Malay words that we believe not to exist in Indonesian, e.g., because they do not appear in our Indonesian monolingual text.</S>
          <S ID="S-12615">This is necessary because of the large number of false friends and partial cognates between Malay and Indonesian (see Section 3).</S>
          <S ID="S-12616">Finally, we decode the confusion network for a Malay sentence using a large Indonesian language model, and we extract an n-best list.</S>
          <S ID="S-12617">5 Table 1 shows the 10-best adapted &#8220;Indonesian&#8221; sentences 6 we generated for the confusion network in Figure 1.</S>

          <S ID="S-12619">Many of our paraphrases are bad: some have very low probabilities, while others involve rare words for which the probability estimates are unreliable.</S>
          <S ID="S-12620">5 For balance, in case of less than n adaptations for a Malay sentence, we randomly repeat some of the available ones.</S>
          <S ID="S-12621">6 According to a native Indonesian speaker, options 1 and 3 in Table 1 are perfect adaptations, options 2 and 5 have a wrong word order, and the rest are grammatical though not perfect.</S>
          <S ID="S-12622">Moreover, the options we propose for a Malay word are inherently restricted to the small Indonesian vocabulary of the Indonesian&#8211;English bi-text.</S>
          <S ID="S-12623">Below we describe how we address these issues.</S>
          <S ID="S-12624">Score-based filtering.</S>
          <S ID="S-12625">We filter out translation pairs whose probabilities (Eq.</S>
          <S ID="S-12626">1) are lower than some threshold (tuned on the dev dataset), e.g., 0.01.</S>
          <S ID="S-12627">Improved estimations for Pr(i|e).</S>
          <S ID="S-12628">We concatenate k copies of the Indonesian&#8211;English bi-text and one copy of the Malay&#8211;English bi-text, where the value of k is selected so that we have roughly the same number of Indonesian and Malay sentences.</S>
          <S ID="S-12629">Then, we generate word-level alignments for the resulting bi-text.</S>
          <S ID="S-12630">Finally, we truncate these alignments keeping them for one copy of the original Indonesian&#8211;English bi-text only.</S>
          <S ID="S-12631">Thus, we end up with improved word alignments for the Indonesian&#8211; English bi-text, and with better estimations for Eq.</S>
          <S ID="S-12632">1.</S>
          <S ID="S-12633">Since Malay and Indonesian share many cognates, this improves word alignments for Indonesian words that occur rarely in the small Indonesian&#8211;English bitext but are relatively frequent in the larger Malay&#8211; English one; it also helps for some frequent words.</S>
          <S ID="S-12634">Cross-lingual morphological variants.</S>
          <S ID="S-12635">We increase the Indonesian options for a Malay word using morphology.</S>
          <S ID="S-12636">Since the set of Indonesian options for a Malay word in pivoting is restricted to the Indonesian vocabulary of the small Indonesian&#8211; English bi-text, this is a severe limitation of pivoting.</S>
          <S ID="S-12637">Thus, assuming a large monolingual Indonesian text, we first build a lexicon of the words in the text.</S>
          <S ID="S-12638">Then, we lemmatize these words using two different lemmatizers: the Malay lemmatizer of <REF ID="R-03" RPTR="3">Baldwin and Awab (2006)</REF>, and a similar Indonesian lemmatizer.</S>
          <S ID="S-12639">Since these two analyzers have different strengths and weaknesses, we combine their outputs to increase recall.</S>
          <S ID="S-12640">Next, we group all Indonesian words that share the same lemma, e.g., for minum, we obtain {diminum, diminumkan, diminumnya, makan-minum, makananminuman, meminum, meminumkan, meminumnya, meminumminuman, minum, minum-minum, minum-minuman, minuman, minumanku, minumannya, peminum, peminumnya, perminum, terminum}.</S>
          <S ID="S-12641">Since Malay and Indonesian are subject to the same morphological processes and share many lemmata, we use such groups to propose Indonesian translation options for a Malay word.</S>
          <S ID="S-12642">We first lemmatize the target Malay word, and then we find all groups of Indonesian words the Malay lemmata belong to.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-12643">The union of these groups is the set of morphological variants that we will add to the confusion network as additional options for the Malay word.</S>
          <S ID="S-12644">7 For example, given seperminuman (&#8216;drinking&#8217;) in the Malay input, we first find its stem minum, and then we get the above example set of Indonesian words, which contains some reasonable substitutes such as minuman (&#8216;drink&#8217;).</S>
          <S ID="S-12645">In the confusion network, the weight of the original Malay word is set to 1, while the weight of a morphological option is one minus the minimum edit distance ratio (<REF ID="R-17" RPTR="23">Ristad and Yianilos, 1998</REF>) between it and the Malay word, multiplied by the highest probability for all pivoting variants for the Malay word.</S>

        <P>
          <S ID="S-12646">Word-level paraphrasing ignores context when generating Indonesian variants, relying on the Indonesian language model to make the right contextual choice.</S>
          <S ID="S-12647">We also try to model context more directly by generating adaptation options at the phrase level.</S>
          <S ID="S-12648">7 While the different morphological forms typically have different meanings, e.g., minum (&#8216;drink&#8217;) vs. peminum (&#8216;drinker&#8217;), in some cases the forms could have the same translation in English, e.g., minum (&#8216;drink&#8217;, verb) vs. minuman (&#8216;drink&#8217;, noun).</S>
          <S ID="S-12649">This is our motivation for trying morphological variants, even though they are almost exclusively derivational, and thus quite risky as translational variants; see also (<REF ID="R-13" RPTR="16">Nakov and Ng, 2011</REF>).</S>

          <S ID="S-12659">However, the two bi-texts are not directly comparable and are clearly not equally good as a source of training data for an Indonesian-English SMT system.</S>
          <S ID="S-12660">For one thing, the &#8220;Indonesian&#8221;&#8211;English bi-text is obtained from n-best lists, i.e., it has exactly n very similar variants for each Malay sentence.</S>
          <S ID="S-12661">Moreover, the original Malay&#8211;English bi-text is much larger in size than the Indonesian&#8211;English one, and now it has been further expanded n times in order to become an &#8220;Indonesian&#8221;&#8211;English bi-text, which means that it will dominate the concatenation due to its size.</S>
          <S ID="S-12662">In order to counter-balance this, we repeat the smaller Indonesian&#8211;English bi-text enough times so that we can make the number of sentences it contains roughly the same as for the &#8220;Indonesian&#8221;&#8211;English bi-text; then we concatenate the two bi-texts and we train an SMT system on the resulting bi-text.</S>

          <S ID="S-12664">Finally, we experiment with a method for combining phrase tables proposed in (<REF ID="R-12" RPTR="14">Nakov and Ng, 2009</REF>; <REF ID="R-14" RPTR="19">Nakov and Ng, 2012</REF>).</S>
          <S ID="S-12665">The first phrase table is extracted from word alignments for the balanced concatenation with repetitions, which are then truncated so that they are kept for only one copy of the Indonesian&#8211;English bi-text.</S>

          <S ID="S-12667">The two tables are then merged as follows: all phrase pairs from the first one are retained, and to them are added those phrase pairs from the second one that are not present in the first one.</S>
          <S ID="S-12668">Each phrase pair retains its original scores, which are further augmented with 1&#8211;3 additional feature scores indicating its origin: the first/second/third feature is 1 if the pair came from the first/second/both table(s), and 0 otherwise.</S>
          <S ID="S-12669">We experiment using all three, the first two, or the first feature only; we also try setting the features to 0.5 instead of 0.</S>
          <S ID="S-12670">This makes the following six combinations (0, 00, 000, .5, .5.5, .5.5.5); on testing, we use the one that achieves the highest BLEU score on the development set.</S>
          <S ID="S-12671">Other possibilities for combining the phrase tables include using alternative decoding paths (<REF ID="R-04" RPTR="4">Birch et al., 2007</REF>), simple linear interpolation, and direct phrase table merging with extra features (Callison- Burch et al., 2006); they were previously found inferior to the last two approaches above (<REF ID="R-12" RPTR="15">Nakov and Ng, 2009</REF>; <REF ID="R-14" RPTR="20">Nakov and Ng, 2012</REF>).</S>

      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-12753">Table 7 shows that both variations perform worse than CN:pivot.</S>
        <S ID="S-12754">We believe this is because lattice encodes many options, but does not use a Malay LM, while 1-best uses a Malay LM, but has to commit to 1-best.</S>

        <S ID="S-12757">We experimented with another pair of closely-related languages, 8 Macedonian (MK) and Bulgarian (BG), using data from a different, non-newswire domain: the OPUS corpus of movie subtitles (<REF ID="R-21" RPTR="27">Tiedemann, 2009</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-12758">We used datasets of sizes that are comparable to those in the previous experiments: 160K MK2EN and 1.5M BG2EN sentence pairs (1.2M and 11.5M EN words).</S>
        <S ID="S-12759">Since the sentences were short, we used 10K MK2EN sentence pairs for tuning and testing (77K and 72K English words).</S>
        <S ID="S-12760">For the LM, we used 9.2M Macedonian and 433M English words.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-12761">Table 8 shows that both CN:* and PPT:* yield statistically significant improvements over balanced concatenation with unadapted BG2EN; system combination with MEMT improves even further.</S>
        <S ID="S-12762">This indicates that our approach can work for other pairs of related languages and even for other domains.</S>
        <S ID="S-12763">We should note though that the improvements here are less sizeable than for Indonesian/Malay.</S>
        <S ID="S-12764">This may be due to our monolingual MK dataset being smaller (10M MK vs. 20M IN words), and too noisy, containing many OCR errors, typos, concatenated words, and even some Bulgarian text.</S>
        <S ID="S-12765">Moreover, Macedonian and Bulgarian are arguably somewhat more dissimilar than Malay and Indonesian.</S>

      <HEADER>8 Conclusion and Future Work</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-12770">We have presented a novel approach for improving machine translation for a resource-poor language by adapting a bi-text for a related resource-rich language, using confusion networks, word/phrase-level paraphrasing, and morphological analysis.</S>
        <S ID="S-12771">We have achieved very significant improvements over several baselines (6.7 BLEU points over an unadapted version of ML2EN, 2.6 BLEU points over IN2EN, and 1.5&#8211;3 BLEU points over three bi-text combinations of ML2EN and IN2EN), thus proving the potential of the idea.</S>
        <S ID="S-12772">We have further demonstrated the applicability of the general approach to other languages and domains.</S>
        <S ID="S-12773">In future work, we would like to add word deletion, insertion, splitting, and concatenation as allowed editing operations.</S>
        <S ID="S-12774">We further want to explore tighter integration of word-based and phrasebased paraphrasing.</S>
        <S ID="S-12775">Finally, we plan experiments with other language pairs and application to other linguistic problems.</S>
