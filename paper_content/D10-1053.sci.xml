      <P>
        <S ID="S-134220">Current practice in hierarchical phrase-based translation extracts regular phrases and hierarchical rules from word-aligned parallel text.</S>
        <S ID="S-134221">Alignment models estimated over the parallel text are used to generate these alignments, but these models are then typically used no further in rule extraction.</S>
        <S ID="S-134222">This is less than ideal because these alignment models, even if they are not suitable for direct use in translation, can still provide a great deal of useful information beyond a single best estimate of the alignment of the parallel text.</S>
        <S ID="S-134223">Our aim is to use alignment models to generate the statistics needed to build translation grammars.</S>
        <S ID="S-134224">The challenge in doing so is to extend the current procedures, which are geared towards the use of a single alignment, to make more of what can be provided by alignment models.</S>
        <S ID="S-134225">The goal is to extract a richer and more robust set of translation rules.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-134226">There are two aspects to hierarchical phrase-based translation grammars which concern us.</S>
        <S ID="S-134227">The first is expressive power, which we take as the ability to generate known reference translations from sentences in the source language.</S>
        <S ID="S-134228">This is determined by the degree of phrase movements and the translations allowed by the rules of the grammar.</S>
        <S ID="S-134229">For a grammar with given types of rules, larger rule sets will yield greater expressive power.</S>
        <S ID="S-134230">This motivates studies of grammars based on the rules which are extracted and the movement the grammar allows.</S>
        <S ID="S-134231">The second aspect is of course translation accuracy.</S>
        <S ID="S-134232">If the expressive power is adequate, then the desire is that the grammar assigns a high score to a correct translation.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-134233">We use posterior probabilities over parallel data to address both of these aspects.</S>
        <S ID="S-134234">These posteriors allow us to build larger rule sets with improved translation accuracy.</S>
        <S ID="S-134235">Ideally, for a sentence pair we wish to consider all possible alignments between all possible source and target phrases within these sentences.</S>
        <S ID="S-134236">Given a grammar allowing certain types of movement, we would then extract all possible parses that are consistent with any alignments of these phrases.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-134237">To make this approach feasible, we consider only phrase-to-phrase alignments with a high posterior probability under the alignment models.</S>
        <S ID="S-134238">In this way, the alignment model probabilities guide rule extraction.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-134239">The paper is organized as follows.</S>
        <S ID="S-134240">Section 2 reviews related work on using posteriors to extract phrases, as well as other approaches that tightly integrate word alignment and rule extraction.</S>
        <S ID="S-134241">Section 3 describes rule extraction based on word and phrase posterior distributions provided by the HMM word-to-word alignment model.</S>
        <S ID="S-134242">In Section 4 we define translation grammars progressively by adding classes of rules to a basic phrase-based system, motivating each rule type by the phrase movement it is intended to achieve.</S>
        <S ID="S-134243">In Section 5 we assess these grammars in terms of their expressive power and the quality of the translations they yield in Chinese-to- English, showing that rule extraction from posteriors gives translation improvements.</S>
        <S ID="S-134244">We also find that the best way to exploit source-to-target and targetto-source alignment models is to build two separate systems and combine their output translation lattices.</S>

        <S ID="S-134248">Alignment n-best lists are also used in <REF ID="R-15" RPTR="20">Liu et al. (2009)</REF> to create a structure called weighted alignment matrices that approximates word-to-word link posterior probabilities, from which phrases are extracted for a phrase-based system.</S>

        <S ID="S-134250">In order to simplify hierarchical phrase-based grammars and make translation feasible with relatively large parallel corpora, some authors discuss the need for various filters during rule extraction (<REF ID="R-05" RPTR="4">Chiang, 2007</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-134251">In particular <REF ID="R-16" RPTR="22">Lopez (2008)</REF> enforces a minimum span of two words per nonterminal, Zollmann et al. (2008) use a minimum count threshold for all rules, and Iglesias et al. (2009) propose a finer-grained filtering strategy based on rule patterns.</S>
        <S ID="S-134252">Other approaches include insisting that targetside rules are well-formed dependency trees (<REF ID="R-22" RPTR="27">Shen et al., 2008</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-134253">We also note approaches to tighter coupling between translation grammars and alignments.</S>
        <S ID="S-134254"><REF ID="R-17" RPTR="23">Marcu and Wong (2002)</REF> describe a joint-probability phrase-based model for alignment, but the approach is limited due to excessive complexity as Viterbi inference becomes NP-hard (<REF ID="R-08" RPTR="8">DeNero and Klein, 2008</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-134255">More recently, Saers et al. (2009) report improvement on a phrase-based system where word alignment has been trained with an inversion transduction grammar (ITG) rather than IBM models.</S>
        <S ID="S-134256"><REF ID="R-20" RPTR="26">Pauls et al. (2010)</REF> also use an ITG to directly align phrases to nodes in a string-to-tree model.</S>
        <S ID="S-134257">Bayesian methods have been recently developed to induce a grammar directly from an unaligned parallel corpus (<REF ID="R-01" RPTR="0">Blunsom et al., 2008</REF>; <REF ID="R-02" RPTR="1">Blunsom et al., 2009</REF>).</S>

        <S ID="S-134259">We take a different approach in that we aim to start with very strong word alignment models and use them to guide grammar extraction.</S>

          <S ID="S-134443">This shows that method PP yields wider coverage but with sharper forward rule translation probability distributions than method WP, as the average number of translations per rule is determined by the p(&#945;|&#947;) &gt; 0.01 threshold mentioned in Section 3.2.</S>

        <P>

          <S ID="S-134453">Our motivation is that symmetrization strategies have been reported to be beneficial for Viterbi extraction methods (<REF ID="R-18" RPTR="24">Och and Ney, 2003</REF>; <REF ID="R-12" RPTR="16">Koehn et al., 2003</REF>).</S>

          <S ID="S-134456">Also, for Viterbi extraction we find that the source-to-target V-st case performs better than any of the symmetrization strategies, which contradicts previous findings for non-hierarchical phrase-based systems(<REF ID="R-12" RPTR="17">Koehn et al., 2003</REF>).</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-134457">We use the PP rule extraction method to extract two sets of rules, under the st and ts alignment models respectively.</S>
          <S ID="S-134458">We now investigate two ways of merging these sets into a single grammar for translation.</S>
          <S ID="S-134459">The first strategy is PP-merge and merges both rule sets by assigning to each rule the maximum count assigned by either alignment model.</S>
          <S ID="S-134460">We then extend the previous strategy by adding three binary feature functions to the system, indicating whether the rule was extracted under the &#8217;st&#8217; model, the &#8217;ts&#8217; model or both.</S>
          <S ID="S-134461">The motivation is that MERT can weight rules differently according to the alignment model they were extracted from.</S>

        </P>
        <P>

          <S ID="S-134464">Gains are consistent when comparing this to applying LMBR to each of the best individual systems (rows named LMBR(V-st) and LMBR(PP-st)).</S>
          <S ID="S-134465">Overall, the best-performing strategy is to extract two sets of translation rules under the phrase pair posteriors in each translation direction, and then to perform translation twice and merge the results.</S>

      <HEADER>6 Conclusion</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-134489">Rule extraction based on alignment posterior probabilities can generate larger rule sets.</S>
        <S ID="S-134490">This results in grammars with more expressive power, as measured by the ability to align parallel sentences.</S>
        <S ID="S-134491">Assigning counts equal to phrase posteriors produces better estimation of rule translation probabilities.</S>
        <S ID="S-134492">This results in improved translation scores as the search space grows.</S>
        <S ID="S-134493">This more exhaustive rule extraction method permits a grammar simplification, as expressed by the phrase movement allowed by its rules.</S>
        <S ID="S-134494">In particular a simple grammar with rules of only one nonterminal is shown to outperform a more complex grammar built on rules extracted from Viterbi alignments.</S>
        <S ID="S-134495">Finally, we find that the best way to exploit alignment models trained in each translation direction is to extract two rule sets based on alignment posteriors, translate the input independently with each rule set and combine translation output lattices.</S>
