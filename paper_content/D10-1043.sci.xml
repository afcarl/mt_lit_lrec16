      <P>
        <S ID="S-9778">Recently syntax-based methods have achieved very promising results and attracted increasing interests in statistical machine translation (SMT) research community due to their ability to provide informative context structure information and convenience in carrying out word transformation and sub-span reordering.</S>
        <S ID="S-9779">Fundamentally, syntax-based SMT views translation as a structural transformation process.</S>
        <S ID="S-9780">Generally speaking, from modeling viewpoint, a syntax-based model tries to convert the source structures into target structures iteratively and recursively while from decoding viewpoint a syntax-based system segments an input tree/forest into many sub-fragments, translates each of them separately, combines the translated sub-fragments and then finds out the best combinations.</S>
        <S ID="S-9781">Therefore, from bilingual viewpoint, we face two fundamental problems: the mapping between bilingual structures and the way of carrying out the target structures combination.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-9782">For the first issue, a number of models have been proposed to model the structure mapping between tree and string (Galley et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2006; Yamada and Knight, 2001; DeNeefe and Knight, 2009) and between tree and tree (Eisner, 2003; Zhang et al., 2007 &amp; 2008; Liu et al., 2009).</S>
        <S ID="S-9783">However, one of the major challenges is that all the current models only allow one-to-one mapping from one source frontier non-terminal node (Galley et al., 2004) to one target frontier non-terminal node in a bilingual translation rule.</S>
        <S ID="S-9784">Therefore, all those translation equivalents with one-to-many frontier non-terminal node mapping cannot be covered by the current state-of-the-art models.</S>
        <S ID="S-9785">This may largely compromise the modeling ability of translation rules.</S>
        <S ID="S-9786">For the second problem, currently, the combination is driven by only the source side (both tree-to-string model and tree-to-tree model only check the source span compatibility when combining different target structures in decoding) or only the</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-9787">target side (string to tree model).</S>
        <S ID="S-9788">There is no well study in considering both the source side information and the compatibility between different target syntactic structures during combination.</S>
        <S ID="S-9789">In addition, it is well known that the traditional tree-to-tree models suffer heavily from the data sparseness issue in training and the spurious-ambiguity translation path issue (the same translation with different syntactic structures) in decoding.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-9790">In addition, because of the performance limitation of automatic syntactic parser, researchers propose using packed forest (Tomita, 1987; Klein and Manning, 2001; Huang, 2008) 1 instead of 1-best parse tree to carry out training (Mi and Huang, 2008) and decoding (Mi et al., 2008) in order to reduce the side effect caused by parsing errors of the one-best tree.</S>
        <S ID="S-9791">However, when we apply the tree-to-tree model to the bilingual forest structures, both training and decoding become very complicated.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-9792">In this paper, to address the first issue, we propose a framework to model the non-isomorphic translation process from source tree fragment to target tree sequence, allowing any one source frontier non-terminal node to be translated into any number of target frontier non-terminal nodes.</S>
        <S ID="S-9793">For the second issue, we propose a technology to model the combination task by considering both sides&#8217; syntactic structure information.</S>
        <S ID="S-9794">We evaluate and integrate the two technologies into forest-based tree to tree sequence translation.</S>
        <S ID="S-9795">Experimental results on the NIST-2003 and NIST-2005 Chinese-English translation tasks show that our methods significantly outperform the forest-based tree to string and previous tree to tree models as well as the phrase-based model.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-9796">The remaining of the paper is organized as following.</S>
        <S ID="S-9797">Section 2 reviews the related work.</S>
        <S ID="S-9798">In section 3 and section 4, we discuss the proposed forest-based rule extraction (non-isomorphic mapping) and decoding algorithms (target syntax information usage).</S>
        <S ID="S-9799">Finally we report the experimental results in section 5 and conclude the paper in section 6.</S>

        <S ID="S-9816">One common limitation of the above works is they only allow the one-to-one mapping between each non-terminal frontier node, and thus they suffer from the issue of rule coverage.</S>
        <S ID="S-9817">On the other hand, due to the data sparseness issue and model coverage issue, previous tree-to-tree (Zhang et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2009) decoder has to rely solely on the span information or source side information to combine the target syntactic structures, without checking the compatibility of the merging nodes, in order not to fail many translation paths.</S>
        <S ID="S-9818">Thus, this solution fails to effectively utilize the target structure information.</S>

        <S ID="S-9819">To address this issue, tree sequence (Liu et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2008) and virtual node (Zhang et al., 2009a) are two concepts with promising results reported.</S>
        <S ID="S-9820">In this paper, with the help of these two concepts, we propose a novel framework to solve the one-to-many non-isomorphic mapping issue.</S>
        <S ID="S-9821">In addition, our proposed solution of using target syntax information enables our forest-based tree-to-tree sequence translation decoding algorithm to not only capture bilingual forest information but also have almost the same complexity as forest-based tree-to-string translation.</S>
        <S ID="S-9822">This reduces the time/space complexity exponentially.</S>

        <P>
          <S ID="S-9953">As we could see in section 4.1, there is only one kind of non-terminal symbol &#8220;X&#8221; in the target side.</S>
          <S ID="S-9954">It is a big challenge to rely on such a coarse label to generate a translation with fine syntactic quality.</S>
          <S ID="S-9955">For example, a source node may be translated into a &#8220;NP&#8221; (noun phrase) in target side.</S>
          <S ID="S-9956">However, in this rule set with the only symbol &#8220;X&#8221;, it may be merged with upper structure as a &#8220;VP&#8221; (verb phrase) instead, because there is no way to favor one over another.</S>
          <S ID="S-9957">In this case, the target tree does not well model the translation syntactically.</S>
          <S ID="S-9958">In addition, all of the internal structure information in the target side is ignored by the tree-to-string rules.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-9959">One natural solution to the above issue is to use the tree to tree/tree sequence model, which have richer target syntax structures for more discriminative probability and finer labels to guide the combination process.</S>
          <S ID="S-9960">However, the tree to tree/tree sequence model may face very severe computational problem and so-called &#8220;spurious ambiguities&#8221; issue.</S>
          <S ID="S-9961">Theoretically, if in the tree-to-tree sequence model-based decoding, we just give a penalty to the incompatible-node combinations instead of pruning out the translation paths, then the set of sentences generated by the tree-to-tree sequence model is identical to that of the tree-to-string model since every tree-to-tree sequence rule can be projected into a tree-to-string rule.</S>
          <S ID="S-9962">Motivated by this, we propose a solution call parallel hypothesis spaces searching to solve the computational and &#8220;spurious ambiguities&#8221; issues mentioned above.</S>

      <HEADER>6 Conclusions</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-10086">In this paper, we propose a framework to address the issue of bilingual non-isomorphic structure mapping and a novel parallel searching space scheme to effectively utilize target syntactic structure information in the context of forest-based tree to tree sequence machine translation.</S>
        <S ID="S-10087">Based on this framework, we design an efficient algorithm to extract tree-to-tree sequence translation rules from word aligned bilingual forest pairs.</S>
        <S ID="S-10088">We also elaborate the parallel searching space-based decoding algorithm and the node label checking scheme, which leads to very efficient decoding speed as fast as the forest-based tree-to-string model does, at the same time is able to utilize informative target structure knowledge.</S>
        <S ID="S-10089">We evaluate our methods on both small and large training data sets and two NIST test sets.</S>
        <S ID="S-10090">Experimental results show our methods statistically significantly outperform the state-of-the-art models across different size of corpora and different test sets.</S>
        <S ID="S-10091">In the future, we are interested in testing our algorithm at forest-based tree sequence to tree sequence translation.</S>
