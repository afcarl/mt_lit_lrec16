      <P>
        <S ID="S-28609">Hidden Markov Tree Models (HMTM) were introduced in (<REF ID="R-03" RPTR="2">Crouse et al., 1998</REF>) and used in applications such as image segmentation, signal classification, denoising, and image document categorization, see (<REF ID="R-05" RPTR="4">Durand et al., 2004</REF>) for references.</S>

        <S ID="S-28610">Although Hidden Markov Models belong to the most successful techniques in Computational Linguistics (CL), the HMTM modification remains to the best of our knowledge unknown in the field.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-28611">The first novel claim made in this paper is that the independence assumptions made by Markov Tree Models can be useful for modeling syntactic trees.</S>
        <S ID="S-28612">Especially, they fit dependency trees well, because these models assume conditional dependence (in the probabilistic sense) only along tree</S>

        <S ID="S-28616">edges, which corresponds to intuition behind dependency relations (in the linguistic sense) in dependency trees.</S>
        <S ID="S-28617">Moreover, analogously to applications of HMM on sequence labeling, HMTM can be used for labeling nodes of a dependency tree, interpreted as revealing the hidden states 1 in the tree nodes, given another (observable) labeling of the nodes of the same tree.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-28618">The second novel claim is that HMTMs are suitable for modeling the transfer phase in Machine Translation systems based on deep-syntactic dependency trees.</S>
        <S ID="S-28619">Emission probabilities represent the translation model, whereas transition (edge) probabilities represent the target-language tree model.</S>
        <S ID="S-28620">This decomposition can be seen as a tree-shaped analogy to the popular n-gram approaches to Statistical Machine Translation (e.g. (<REF ID="R-07" RPTR="7">Koehn et al., 2003</REF>)), in which translation and language models are trainable separately too.</S>
        <S ID="S-28621">Moreover, given the input dependency tree and HMTM parameters, there is a computationally efficient HMTM-modified Viterbi algorithm for finding the globally optimal target dependency tree.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-28622">It should be noted that when using HMTM, the source-language and target-language trees are required to be isomorphic.</S>
        <S ID="S-28623">Obviously, this is an unrealistic assumption in real translation.</S>
        <S ID="S-28624">However, we argue that tectogrammatical deep-syntactic dependency trees (as introduced in the Functional Generative Description framework, (<REF ID="R-09" RPTR="9">Sgall, 1967</REF>)) are relatively close to this requirement, which makes the HMTM approach practically testable.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-28625">As for the related work, one can found a number of experiments with dependency-based MT in the literature, e.g., (<REF ID="R-00" RPTR="0">Boguslavsky et al., 2004</REF>), (<REF ID="R-08" RPTR="8">Menezes and Richardson, 2001</REF>), (<REF ID="R-01" RPTR="1">Bojar, 2008</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-28626">However, to our knowledge none of the published systems searches for the optimal target representa-</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-28627">1 HMTM looses the HMM&#8217;s time and finite automaton interpretability, as the observations are not organized linearly.</S>
        <S ID="S-28628">However, the terms &#8220;state&#8221; and &#8220;transition&#8221; are still used.</S>

        <S ID="S-28675">HMTM Assumptions from the MT Viewpoint.</S>
        <S ID="S-28676">We suggest to use HMTM in the conventional tree-based analysis-transfer-synthesis translation scheme: (1) First we analyze an input sentence to a certain level of abstraction on which the sentence representation is tree-shaped.</S>
        <S ID="S-28677">(2) Then we use HMTM-modified Viterbi algorithm for creating the target-language tree from the source-language tree.</S>
        <S ID="S-28678">Labels on the source-language nodes are treated as emitted (observable) symbols, while labels on the target-language nodes are understood as hidden states which are being searched for</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-28679">3 The need for parametrizing also P (X(r)) (prior probabilites of hidden states in the root node) can be avoided by adding an artificial root whose state is fixed.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-28680">(Figure 1).</S>
        <S ID="S-28681">(3) Finally, we synthesize the targetlanguage sentence from the target-language tree.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-28682">In the HMTM transfer step, the HMTM emission probabilities can be interpreted as probabilities from the &#8220;backward&#8221; (source given target) node-to-node translation model.</S>
        <S ID="S-28683">HMTM transition probabilities can be interpreted as probabilities from the target-language tree model.</S>
        <S ID="S-28684">This is an important feature from the MT viewpoint, since the decomposition into translation model and language model proved to be extremely useful in statistical MT since (Brown et al., 1993).</S>
        <S ID="S-28685">It allows to compensate the lack of parallel resources by the relative abundance of monolingual resources.</S>
        <S ID="S-28686">Another advantage of the HMTM approach is that it allows us to disregard the ordering of decisions made with the individual nodes (which would be otherwise nontrivial, as for a given node there might be constraints and preferences coming both from its parent and from its children).</S>
        <S ID="S-28687">Like in HMM, it is the notion of hidden states that facilitates &#8220;summarizing&#8221; distributed information and finding the global optimum.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-28688">On the other hand, there are several limitations implied by HMTMs which we have to consider before applying it to MT: (1) There can be only one labeling function on the source-language nodes, and one labeling function on the target-language nodes.</S>
        <S ID="S-28689">(2) The set of hidden states and the alphabet of emitted symbols must be finite.</S>
        <S ID="S-28690">(3) The source-language tree and the target-language tree are required to be isomorphic.</S>
        <S ID="S-28691">In other words, only node labeling can be changed in the transfer step.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-28692">The first two assumption are easy to fulfill, but the third assumption concerning the tree isomorphism is problematic.</S>
        <S ID="S-28693">There is no known linguistic theory guaranteeing identically shaped tree representations of a sentence and its translation.</S>
        <S ID="S-28694">However, we would like to show in the following that the tectogrammatical layer of language description is close enough to this ideal to make the HMTM approach practically applicable.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-28695">Why Tectogrammatical Trees?</S>
        <S ID="S-28696">Tectogrammatical layer of language description was introduced within the Functional Generative Description framework, (<REF ID="R-09" RPTR="10">Sgall, 1967</REF>) and has been further elaborated in the Prague Dependency Treebank project, (Haji&#269; and others, 2006).</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-28697">On the tectogrammatical layer, each sentence is represented as a tectogrammatical tree (t-tree for short; abbreviations t-node and t-layer are used in the further text too).</S>
        <S ID="S-28698">The main features of t-trees (from the viewpoint of our experiments) are following.</S>
        <S ID="S-28699">Each sentence is represented as a dependency tree, whose nodes correspond to autosemantic (meaningful) words and whose edges correspond to syntactic-semantic relations (dependencies).</S>
        <S ID="S-28700">The nodes are labeled with the lemmas of the autosemantic words.</S>
        <S ID="S-28701">Functional words (such as prepositions, auxiliary verbs, and subordinating conjunctions) do not have nodes of their own.</S>
        <S ID="S-28702">Information conveyed by word inflection or functional words in the surface sentence shape is represented by specialized semantic attributes attached to t-nodes (such as number or tense).</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-28703">T-trees are still language specific (e.g. because of lemmas), but they largely abstract from language-specific means of expressing non-lexical meanings (such as inflection, agglutination, functional words).</S>
        <S ID="S-28704">Next reason for using t-trees as the transfer medium is that they allow for a natural transfer factorization.</S>
        <S ID="S-28705">One can separate the transfer into three relatively independent channels: 4 (1) transfer of lexicalization (stored in t-node&#8217;s lemma attribute), (2) transfer of syntactizations (stored in t-node&#8217;s formeme attribute), 5 and (3) transfer of semantically indispensable grammatical categories 6 such as number with nouns and tense with verbs (stored in specialized t-node&#8217;s attributes).</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-28706">Another motivation for using t-trees is that we believe that local tree contexts in t-trees carry more information relevant for correct lexical choice, compared to linear contexts in the surface sentence shapes, mainly because of long-distance dependencies and coordination structures.</S>
