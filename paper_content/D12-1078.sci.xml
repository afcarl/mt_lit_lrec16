  <ABSTRACT>
    <A-S ID="S-13815">The training of most syntactic SMT approaches involves two essential components, word alignment and monolingual parser.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-13816">In the current state of the art these two components are mutually independent, thus causing problems like lack of rule generalization, and violation of syntactic correspondence in translation rules.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-13817">In this paper, we propose two ways of re-training monolingual parser with the target of maximizing the consistency between parse trees and alignment matrices.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-13818">One is targeted self-training with a simple evaluation function; the other is based on training data selection from forced alignment of bilingual data.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-13819">We also propose an auxiliary method for boosting alignment quality, by symmetrizing alignment matrices with respect to parse trees.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-13820">The best combination of these novel methods achieves 3 Bleu point gain in an IWSLT task and more than 1 Bleu point gain in NIST tasks.</A-S>

      <P>
        <S ID="S-13821">There are many varieties in syntactic statistical machine translation (SSMT).</S>
        <S ID="S-13822">Apart from a few attempts to use synchronous parsing to produce the tree structure of both source language (SL) and target language (TL) simultaneously, most SSMT approaches make use of monolingual parser to produce the parse tree(s) of the SL and/or TL sentences, and then link up the information of the two languages through word alignment.</S>
        <S ID="S-13823">In the current state of the art, word aligner and monolingual parser are trained and applied separately.</S>
        <S ID="S-13824">On the one hand, an average word aligner does not consider the syntax information of both languages, and the output links may violate syntactic correspondence.</S>
        <S ID="S-13825">That is, some SL words yielded by a SL parse tree node may not be traced to, via alignment links, some TL words with legitimate syntactic structure.</S>
        <S ID="S-13826">On the other hand, parser design is a monolingual activity and its impact on MT is not well studied (Ambati, 2008).</S>
        <S ID="S-13827">Many good translation rules may thus be filtered by a good monolingual parser.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-13828">In this paper we will focus on the translation task from Chinese to English, and the string-to-tree SSMT model as elaborated in (<REF ID="R-05" RPTR="6">Galley et al., 2006</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-13829">There are two kinds of translation rules in this model, minimal rules, and composed rules, which are composition of minimal rules.</S>
        <S ID="S-13830">The minimal rules are extracted from a special kind of nodes, known as frontier nodes, on TL parse tree.</S>
        <S ID="S-13831">The concept of frontier node can be illustrated by Figure 1, which shows two partial bilingual sentences with the corresponding TL sub-trees and word alignment links.</S>
        <S ID="S-13832">The TL words yielded by a TL parse node can be traced to the corresponding SL words through alignment links.</S>
        <S ID="S-13833">In the diagram, each parse node is represented by a rectangle, showing the phrase label, span, and complement span respectively.</S>
        <S ID="S-13834">The span of a TL node is defined as the minimal contiguous SL string that covers all the SL words reachable from .</S>
        <S ID="S-13835">The complement span of is the union of spans of all the nodes that are neither descendants nor ancestors of (c.f.</S>
        <S ID="S-13836"><REF ID="R-05" RPTR="7">Galley et al., 2006</REF>) .</S>
        <S ID="S-13837">A frontier node is a node of which the span and the complement span do not overlap with each other.</S>
        <S ID="S-13838">In the diagram, frontier nodes are grey in color.</S>
        <S ID="S-13839">Frontier node is the key in the SSMT model, as it identifies the bilingual information which is consistent with both the parse tree and alignment matrix.</S>

        <S ID="S-13855">By and large, incorrect alignment links lead to translation rules that are large in size, few in number, and poor in generalization ability (<REF ID="R-04" RPTR="5">Fossum et al, 2008</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-13856">The second problem is parsing error, as shown in Figure 1(b).</S>
        <S ID="S-13857">The incorrect POS tagging of the word &#8220;lectures" causes a series of parsing errors, including the absence of the noun phrase &#8220;NP(NN(propaganda), NN(lectures))&#8221;.</S>
        <S ID="S-13858">These parsing errors hinder the extraction of good rules, such as &#8220; &#23459; &#35762; NP(NN(propaganda), NN(lectures)) &#8221;.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-13859">Note that in Figure 1(a), the parse tree is correct, and the incorrect alignment links might be fixed if the aligner takes the parse tree into consideration.</S>
        <S ID="S-13860">Similarly, in Figure 1(b) some parsing errors might be fixed if the parser takes into consideration the correct alignment links about &#8220;propaganda&#8221; and &#8220;lecture&#8221;.</S>
        <S ID="S-13861">That is, alignment errors and parsing might be fixed if word aligner and parser are not mutually independent.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-13862">In this paper, we emphasize more on the correction of parsing errors by exploiting alignment information.</S>
        <S ID="S-13863">The general approach is to re-train a parser with parse trees which are the most consistent with alignment matrices.</S>
        <S ID="S-13864">Our first strategy is to apply the idea of targeted selftraining (<REF ID="R-07" RPTR="9">Katz-Brown et al., 2011</REF>) with the simple evaluation function of frontier set size.</S>
        <S ID="S-13865">That is to re-train the parser with the parse trees which give rise to the largest number of frontier nodes.</S>
        <S ID="S-13866">The second strategy is to apply forced alignment (<REF ID="R-13" RPTR="16">Wuebker et al., 2010</REF>) to bilingual data and select the parse trees generated by our SSMT system for re-training the parser.</S>
        <S ID="S-13867">Besides, although we do not invent a new word aligner exploiting syntactic information, we propose a new method to symmetrize the alignment matrices of two directions by taking parse tree into consideration.</S>

      <HEADER>2 Parser Re-training Strategies</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-13965">Most monolingual parsers used in SSMT are trained upon certain tree bank.</S>
        <S ID="S-13966">That is, a parser is trained with the target of maximizing the agreement between its decision on syntactic structure and that decision in the human-annotated parse trees.</S>
        <S ID="S-13967">As mentioned in Section 1, monolingual syntactic structure is not necessarily suitable for translation, and sometimes the bilingual information in word alignment may help the parser find out the correct structure.</S>
        <S ID="S-13968">Therefore, it is desirable if there is a way to re-train a parser with bilingual information.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-13969">What is needed includes a framework of parser re-training, and a data selection strategy that maximizes the consistency between parse tree and alignment matrix.</S>
        <S ID="S-13970">Our two solutions will be introduced in the next two subsections respectively.</S>

        <HEADER>2.1 Targeted Self-Training with Frontier Set Based Evaluation (TST-FS)</HEADER>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-13868">The first solution is based on targeted self-training (TST) (<REF ID="R-07" RPTR="10">Katz-Brown et al., 2011</REF>).</S>
          <S ID="S-13869">In standard selftraining, the top one parse trees produced by the current parser are taken as training data for the next round, and the training objective is still the correctness of monolingual syntactic structure.</S>
          <S ID="S-13870">In targeted self-training, the training objective shifts to certain external evaluation function.</S>
          <S ID="S-13871">For each sentence, the n-best parse trees from the current parser are re-ranked in accordance with this external evaluation function, and the top one of the re-ranked candidates is then selected as training data for the next round.</S>
          <S ID="S-13872">The key of targeted selftraining is the definition of this external evaluation function.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-13873">As shown by the example in Figure 1(b), an incorrect parse tree is likely to hinder the extraction of good translation rules, because the number of frontier nodes in the incorrect tree is in general smaller than that in the correct tree.</S>
          <S ID="S-13874">Consider the example in Figure 2, which is about the same partial bilingual sentence as in Figure 1(b).</S>
          <S ID="S-13875">Although both parse trees do not have the correct syntactic structure, the tree in Figure 2 has more frontier nodes, leads to more valid translation rules, and is therefore more preferable.</S>

        <P>
          <S ID="S-13876">This example suggests a very simple external evaluation function, viz.</S>

        <S ID="S-14090">To improve the performance of syntactic machine translation, <REF ID="R-06" RPTR="8">Huang and Knight (2006)</REF> proposed a method incorporating a handful of relabeling strategies to modify the syntactic trees structures.</S>
        <S ID="S-14091"><REF ID="R-00" RPTR="0">Ambati and Lavie (2008)</REF> restructured target parse trees to generate highly isomorphic target trees that preserve the syntactic boundaries of constituents aligned in the original parse trees.</S>
        <S ID="S-14092"><REF ID="R-09" RPTR="12">Wang et al., (2010)</REF> proposed to use re-structuring and re-labeling to modify the parser tree.</S>
        <S ID="S-14093">The restructuring method uses a binarization method to enable the reuse of sub-constituent structures, and the linguistic and statistical re-labeling methods to handle the coarse nonterminal problem, so as to enhance generalization ability.</S>
        <S ID="S-14094">Different from the previous work of modifying tree structures with post-processing methods, our methods try to learn a suitable grammar for string-to-tree SMT models, and directly produce trees which are consistent with word alignment matrices.</S>

      <P>
        <S ID="S-14095">Instead of modifying the parse tree to improve machine translation performance, many methods were proposed to modify word alignment by taking syntactic tree into consideration, including deleting incorrect word alignment links by a discriminative model (<REF ID="R-04" RPTR="4">Fossum et al., 2008</REF>), re-aligning sentence pairs using EM method with the rules extracted with initial alignment (Wang et al., 2010), and removing ambiguous alignment of functional words with constraint from chunk-level information during rule extraction (<REF ID="R-10" RPTR="13">Wu et al., 2011</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-14096">Unlike all these pursuits, to generate a consistent word alignment, our method modifies the popularly used IDG symmetrization method to make it suitable for string-to-tree rule extraction, and our method is much simpler and faster than the previous works.</S>

      <P>
        <S ID="S-14097">In this paper we have attempted to improve SSMT by reducing the errors introduced by the mutual independence between monolingual parser and word aligner.</S>
        <S ID="S-14098">Our major contribution is the strategies of re-training parser with the bilingual information in alignment matrices.</S>
        <S ID="S-14099">Either of our proposals of targeted self-training with frontier set size as evaluation function and forced alignment based re-training is more effective than baseline</S>
