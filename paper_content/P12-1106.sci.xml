    <A-S ID="S-35433">An ideal summarization system should produce summaries that have high content coverage and linguistic quality.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-35434">Many state-ofthe-art summarization systems focus on content coverage by extracting content-dense sentences from source articles.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-35435">A current research focus is to process these sentences so that they read fluently as a whole.</A-S>

    <A-S ID="S-35437">In this work, we adapt a machine translation metric to measure content coverage, apply an enhanced discourse coherence model to evaluate summary readability, and combine both in a trained regression model to evaluate overall responsiveness.</A-S>

      <P>
        <S ID="S-35439">Research and development on automatic and manual evaluation of summarization systems have been mainly focused on content coverage (<REF ID="R-12" RPTR="9">Lin and Hovy, 2003</REF>; <REF ID="R-17" RPTR="23">Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004</REF>; <REF ID="R-08" RPTR="5">Hovy et al., 2006</REF>; Zhou et al., 2006).</S>
        <S ID="S-35440">However, users may still find it difficult to read such high-content coverage summaries as they lack fluency.</S>
        <S ID="S-35441">To promote research on automatic evaluation of summary readability, the Text Analysis Conference (TAC) (<REF ID="R-20" RPTR="34">Owczarzak and Dang, 2011</REF>) introduced a new subtask on readability to its Automatically Evaluating Summaries of Peers (AESOP) task.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-35442">Most of the state-of-the-art summarization systems (<REF ID="R-18" RPTR="24">Ng et al., 2011</REF>; <REF ID="R-26" RPTR="41">Zhang et al., 2011</REF>; Conroy et al., 2011) are extraction-based.</S>
        <S ID="S-35443">They extract the most content-dense sentences from source articles.</S>
        <S ID="S-35444">If no post-processing is performed to the generated summaries, the presentation of the extracted sentences may confuse readers.</S>
        <S ID="S-35445"><REF ID="R-10" RPTR="7">Knott (1996)</REF> argued that when the sentences of a text are randomly ordered, the text becomes difficult to understand, as its discourse structure is disturbed.</S>
        <S ID="S-35446"><REF ID="R-15" RPTR="16">Lin et al. (2011)</REF><REF ID="R-19" RPTR="25">(2011)</REF><REF ID="R-27" RPTR="42">(2011)</REF> validated this argument by using a trained model to differentiate an original text from a randomlyordered permutation of its sentences by looking at their discourse structures.</S>
        <S ID="S-35447">This prior work leads us to believe that we can apply such discourse models to evaluate the readability of extract-based summaries.</S>
        <S ID="S-35448">We will discuss the application of Lin et al.&#8217;s discourse coherence model to evaluate readability of machine generated summaries.</S>
        <S ID="S-35449">We also introduce two new feature sources to enhance the model with hierarchical and Explicit/Non-Explicit information, and demonstrate that they improve the original model.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-35450">There are parallels between evaluations of machine translation (MT) and summarization with respect to textual content.</S>
        <S ID="S-35451">For instance, the widely used ROUGE (<REF ID="R-12" RPTR="10">Lin and Hovy, 2003</REF>) metrics are influenced by BLEU (<REF ID="R-22" RPTR="36">Papineni et al., 2002</REF>): both look at surface n-gram overlap for content coverage.</S>
        <S ID="S-35452">Motivated by this, we will adapt a state-of-theart, linear programming-based MT evaluation metric, TESLA (<REF ID="R-16" RPTR="19">Liu et al., 2010</REF>), to evaluate the content coverage of summaries.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-35453">TAC&#8217;s overall responsiveness metric evaluates the</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-35454">quality of a summary with regard to both its content and readability.</S>
        <S ID="S-35455">Given this, we combine our two component coherence and content models into an SVM-trained regression model as our surrogate to overall responsiveness.</S>
        <S ID="S-35456">Our experiments show that the coherence model significantly outperforms all AESOP 2011 submissions on both initial and update tasks, while the adapted MT evaluation metric and the combined model significantly outperform all submissions on the initial task.</S>
        <S ID="S-35457">To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that applies a discourse coherence model to measure the readability of summaries in the AESOP task.</S>
