      <HEADER>1 Introduction</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-14177">Machine translation (MT) has benefited a lot from the advancement of automatic evaluation in the past decade.</S>
        <S ID="S-14178">To a certain degree, its progress is also confined to the limitations of evaluation metrics in use.</S>
        <S ID="S-14179">Most efforts devoted to evaluate the quality of MT output so far have still focused on the sentence level without sufficient attention to how a larger text is structured.</S>
        <S ID="S-14180">This is notably reflected in the representative MT evaluation metrics, such as BLEU (<REF ID="R-25" RPTR="22">Papineni et al., 2002</REF>), METEOR (<REF ID="R-00" RPTR="0">Banerjee and Lavie, 2005</REF>) and TER (<REF ID="R-29" RPTR="26">Snover et al., 2006</REF>), that adopt a sentence-by-sentence fashion to score MT outputs.</S>
        <S ID="S-14181">The evaluation result for a document by any of them is usually a simple average of its sentence scores.</S>
        <S ID="S-14182">A drawback of this kind of sentence-based evaluation is the neglect of document structure.</S>
        <S ID="S-14183">There is no guarantee for the coherence of a text if it is produced by simply putting together stand-alone sentences, no matter how well-translated, without adequate intersentential connection.</S>
        <S ID="S-14184">As a consequence, MT system optimized this way to any of these metrics can only have a very dim chance of producing translated document that reads as natural as human writing.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-14185">The accuracy of MT output at the document level is particularly important to MT users, for they care about the overall meaning of a text in question more than the grammatical correctness of each sentence (Visser and Fuji, 1996).</S>
        <S ID="S-14186">Post-editors particularly need to ensure the quality of a whole document of MT output when revising its sentences.</S>
        <S ID="S-14187">The connectivity of sentences is surely a significant factor contributing to the understandability of a text as a whole.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-14188">This paper studies the inter-sentential linguistic features of cohesion and coherence and presents plausible ways to incorporate them into the sentence-based metrics to support MT evaluation at the document level.</S>
        <S ID="S-14189">In the Framework for MT Evaluation in the International Standards of Language Engineering (FEMTI) (<REF ID="R-12" RPTR="12">King et al., 2003</REF>), coherence is defined as &#8220;the degree to which the reader can describe the role of each individual sentence (or group of sentences) with respect to the text as a whole&#8221;.</S>
        <S ID="S-14190">The measurement of coherence has to rely on cohesion, referring to the &#8220;relations of meaning that exist within the text&#8221; (<REF ID="R-09" RPTR="9">Halliday and Hasan, 1976</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-14191">Cohesion is realized via the interlinkage of grammatical and lexical elements across sentences.</S>
        <S ID="S-14192">Grammatical</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-14193">cohesion refers to the syntactic links between text items, while lexical cohesion is achieved through the word choices in a text.</S>
        <S ID="S-14194">This paper focuses on the latter.</S>
        <S ID="S-14195">A quantitative comparison of lexical cohesion devices between MT output and human translation is first conducted, to examine the weakness of current MT systems in handling this feature.</S>
        <S ID="S-14196">Different ways of exploiting lexical cohesion devices for MT evaluation at the document level are then illustrated.</S>

        <S ID="S-14197">Cohesion and coherence are both necessary monolingual features in a target text.</S>
        <S ID="S-14198">They can hardly be evaluated in isolation and have to be conjoined with other quality criteria such as adequacy and fluency.</S>
        <S ID="S-14199">A survey of MT post-editing (Vasconcellos, 1989) suggests that cohesion and coherence serve as higher level quality criteria beyond many others such as syntactic well-formedness.</S>
        <S ID="S-14200">Post-editors tend to correct syntactic errors first before any amendment for improving the cohesion and coherence of an MT output.</S>
        <S ID="S-14201">Also, as Wilks (1978) 1 noted, it is rather unlikely for a sufficiently large sample of translations to be coherent and totally wrong at the same time.</S>
        <S ID="S-14202">Cohesion and coherence are appropriate to serve as criteria for the overall quality of MT output.</S>

        <S ID="S-14211">For lexical cohesion, it has been only partially and indirectly addressed in terms of translation consistency in MT output.</S>
        <S ID="S-14212">Different approaches to maintaining consistency in target word choices are proposed (Itagaki et al., 2007; <REF ID="R-08" RPTR="8">Gong et al., 2011</REF>; Xiao et al., 2011).</S>

      <P>
        <S ID="S-14214">Nevertheless there are only a few evaluation methods explicitly targeting on the quality of a document.</S>

        <S ID="S-14216"><REF ID="R-29" RPTR="25">Snover et al. (2006)</REF> proposes HTER to assess post-editing effort through human annotation.</S>
        <S ID="S-14217">Its automatic versions TER and TERp (<REF ID="R-31" RPTR="27">Snover et al., 2009</REF>), however, remain sentencebased metrics.</S>
        <S ID="S-14218"><REF ID="R-06" RPTR="6">Comelles et al. (2010)</REF> present a family of automatic MT evaluation measures, based on the Discourse Representation Theory (<REF ID="R-11" RPTR="11">Kamp and Reyle, 1993</REF>), that generate semantic trees to put together different text entities for the same referent according to their contexts and grammatical connections.</S>
        <S ID="S-14219">Apart from MT evaluation, automated essay scoring programs such as E-rater (<REF ID="R-02" RPTR="2">Burstein, 2003</REF>) also employ a rich set of discourse features for assessment.</S>
        <S ID="S-14220">However, the parsing process needed for these linguistic-heavy approaches may suffer seriously from grammatical errors, which are unavoidable in MT output.</S>
        <S ID="S-14221">Hence their accuracy and reliability inevitably fluctuate in accord with different evaluation data.</S>
        <S ID="S-14222">Lexical cohesion has far been neglected in both MT and MT evaluation, even though it is the single most important form of cohesion devices, accounting for nearly half of the cohesion devices in English (<REF ID="R-09" RPTR="10">Halliday and Hasan, 1976</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-14223">It is also a significant feature contributing to translation equivalence of texts by preserving their texture (Lotfipour-Saedi, 1997).</S>

        <S ID="S-14226">There are many methods of computing lexical chains for various purposes, e.g., <REF ID="R-17" RPTR="16">Morris and Hirst (1991)</REF>, <REF ID="R-01" RPTR="1">Barzilay and Elhadad (1997)</REF>, <REF ID="R-05" RPTR="5">Chan (2004)</REF>, Li et al. (2007), among many others.</S>
        <S ID="S-14227">Contrary to grammatical cohesion highly depending on syntactic well-formedness of a text, lexical cohesion is less affected by grammatical errors.</S>
        <S ID="S-14228">Its computation has to rely on a thesaurus, which is usually available for almost every language.</S>
        <S ID="S-14229">In this research, a number of formulations of lexical cohesion, with or without reliance on external language resource, will be explored for the purpose of MT evaluation.</S>

          <S ID="S-14238">In between the two ends is to use a synonym (or near-synonym) and superordinate.</S>
          <S ID="S-14239">Collocation refers to those lexical items that share the same or similar semantic relations, including complementarity, antonym, converse, coordinate term, meronym, troponym, and so on.</S>

        <P>
          <S ID="S-14240">In this study, lexical cohesion devices are defined as content words (i.e., tokens after stopword having been removed) that reiterate once or more times in a document, including synonym, near-synonym and superordinate, besides those repetition and collocation.</S>

          <S ID="S-14243">To classify the semantic relationships of words, WordNet (<REF ID="R-07" RPTR="7">Fellbaum, 1998</REF>) is used as a lexical resource, which clusters words of the same sense (i.e., synonyms) into a semantic group, namely a synset.</S>

      <HEADER>4 MT Evaluation at Document Level</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-14303">As a feature at the discourse level, lexical cohesion is a good complement to current evaluation metrics focusing on features at the sentence level.</S>
        <S ID="S-14304">Table 3 illustrates an example selected from the MetricsMATR dataset, consisting two versions of MT output for a short document of two segments only.</S>
        <S ID="S-14305">The n-grams matched with the reference are underlined, while the lexical cohesion devices are italicized.</S>
        <S ID="S-14306">The two MT outputs have a similar number of matched n-grams and hence receive similar BLEU scores.</S>
        <S ID="S-14307">These scores, however, do not reflect their real difference in quality: the second version is better, according to human assessment of adequacy.</S>
        <S ID="S-14308">Instead, their LC ratios seem to represent such a variation more accurately.</S>
        <S ID="S-14309">The theme of the second output is also highlighted through the lexical chains, including main/important, technology/technologies and achieve/achieving, which create a tight texture between the two sentences, a crucial factor of text quality.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-14310">To perform MT evaluation at the document level, the LC and RC ratios can be used alone or integrated into a sentence-level metric.</S>
        <S ID="S-14311">The former way has an advantage that it does not have to rely on any reference translation.</S>
        <S ID="S-14312">LC mainly requires a thesaurus for computing semantic relation, while RC only needs a morphological processor such as stemmer, both of which are available for most lan-</S>

        <S ID="S-14314">Its drawback, however, lies in the risk of relying on a single discourse feature.</S>
        <S ID="S-14315">Although lexical cohesion gives a strong indication of text coherence, it is not indispensable, because a text can be coherent without any surface cohesive clue.</S>
        <S ID="S-14316">Furthermore, the quality of a document is also reflected in that of its sentences.</S>
        <S ID="S-14317">A coherent translation may be mistranslated, and on the other hand, a text containing lots of sentence-level errors would make it difficult to determine its document-level quality.</S>
        <S ID="S-14318">A previous study comparing MT evaluation at the sentence versus document level (Wong et al., 2011) reports a poor consistency in the evaluation results at these two levels when the sentence-level scores of MT output are low.</S>
        <S ID="S-14319">In regard of these, how to integrate these two levels of MT evaluation is particularly worth studying.</S>

        <S ID="S-14321">Three evaluation metrics, namely BLEU, TER and METEOR, 2 are selected for testing.</S>
        <S ID="S-14322">They represent three distinctive types of evaluation metrics: n-gram, editdistance, and unigram with external language resources, respectively.</S>
        <S ID="S-14323">These metrics are evaluated in terms of their correlation with human assessments, using Pearson&#8217;s r correlation coefficient.</S>

        <S ID="S-14325">Note that the adequacy assessment is in fact an evaluation method for the sentence level.</S>
        <S ID="S-14326">We have to rely on an assumption that this evaluation data may emulate document-level quality, since its MT outputs were assessed sentence by sentence in sequence as in a document.</S>

        <S ID="S-14354">This accounts for the significant performance gain from their combination: their difference allows them to complement each other.</S>
        <S ID="S-14355">It is also worth noting that between METEOR and LC the correlation of 0.437 is mildly strong, explaining the negative result of their integration.</S>
        <S ID="S-14356">On the one hand, lexical cohesion is word choice oriented, which is only sensitive to the reiteration and semantic relatedness of words in MT output.</S>

      <HEADER>6 Discussion and Conclusion</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-14359">In this study we have attempted to address the problem that most existing MT evaluation metrics disregard the connectivity of sentences in a document.</S>
        <S ID="S-14360">By focusing on a typical type of cohesion, i.e., lexical cohesion, we have shown that its use frequency is a significant factor to differentiate HT from MT and MT outputs of different quality from each other.</S>
        <S ID="S-14361">The high correlation rate of its use with translation adequacy also suggests that the more lexical cohesion devices in use, the better the quality of MT output.</S>
        <S ID="S-14362">Accordingly we have used two ratios, LC and RC, to capture such correlativity.</S>
        <S ID="S-14363">Our experimental results have confirmed the effectiveness of this feature in accounting for the document-level quality of MT output.</S>
        <S ID="S-14364">The performance of two evaluation metrics, BLEU and TER, is highly improved through incorporating this document-level feature, in terms of the 1066 change of their correlation with human assessments.</S>
        <S ID="S-14365">This finding is positive and sheds light on a region of MT research that is still severely under-explored.</S>
        <S ID="S-14366">Our approach to extending the granularity of MT evaluation from sentence to document through lexical cohesion is highly applicable to different languages.</S>
        <S ID="S-14367">It has a relatively weak demand for language resource in comparison with the processing of other discourse features like grammatical cohesion.</S>
        <S ID="S-14368">It is also much unaffected by grammatical problems or errors commonly seen in natural languages and, in particular, MT outputs.</S>
        <S ID="S-14369">Our future work will continue to explore the relationship of lexical cohesion to translation quality, so as to identify, apart from its use frequency, other significant aspects for MT evaluation at the document level.</S>
        <S ID="S-14370">A frequent use of cohesion devices in a text is not necessarily appropriate, because an excess of them may decrease the quality and readability of a text.</S>
        <S ID="S-14371">Human writers can strategically change the ways of expression to achieve appropriate coherence and also avoid overuse of the same lexical item.</S>
        <S ID="S-14372">To a certain extent, this is one of the causes for the unnaturalness of MT output: it may contain a large number of lexical cohesion devices which are simply direct translation of those in a source text that do not fit in the target context.</S>
        <S ID="S-14373">How to use lexical cohesion devices appropriately instead of frequently is thus an important issue to tackle before we can adopt them in MT and MT evaluation by a suitable means.</S>
