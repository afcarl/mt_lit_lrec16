      <P>
        <S ID="S-49512">The goal of the WMT 2012 Quality Estimation (QE) shared task (<REF ID="R-00" RPTR="0">Callison-Burch et al., 2012</REF>) was to create automatic systems to judge the quality of the translations produced by a Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) system given the input text, the proposed translations and information about the models used by the SMT system.</S>
        <S ID="S-49513">The shared task organisers provided a training set of 1832 sentences drawn from earlier WMT Machine Translation test sets, translated from English to Spanish with a phrase-based SMT system, along with the models used and diagnostic output produced by the SMT system as well as manual translation quality annotations on a 1&#8211;5 scale for each sentence.</S>
        <S ID="S-49514">Additionally, a set of 17 baseline features was made available to the participants.</S>
        <S ID="S-49515">Systems were evaluated on a test set of 422 sentences annotated in the same way.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-49516">Uppsala University submitted two systems to this shared task.</S>
        <S ID="S-49517">Our systems were fairly successful and achieved results that were outperformed by only one competing group.</S>
        <S ID="S-49518">They improve over the baseline performance in two ways, building on and extending earlier work by <REF ID="R-05" RPTR="5">Hardmeier (2011)</REF>, on which the system description in the following sections is partly based: On the one hand, we enhance the set of 17 baseline features provided by the organisers with another 82 explicitly defined features.</S>
        <S ID="S-49519">On the other hand, we use syntactic tree kernels to extract implicit features from constituency and dependency parse trees over the input sentences and the Machine Translation (MT) output.</S>
        <S ID="S-49520">The experimental results confirm the findings of our earlier work, showing tree kernels to be a valuable tool for rapid prototyping of QE systems.</S>

      <HEADER>2 Features</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-49584">Our QE systems used two types of features: On the one hand, we used a set of explicit features that were extracted from the data before running the Machine Learning (ML) component.</S>
        <S ID="S-49585">On the other hand, syntactic parse trees of the MT input and output sentences provided implicit features that were computed directly by the ML component using tree kernels.</S>

        <HEADER>2.1 Explicit features</HEADER>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-49521">Both of the QE systems we submitted to the shared task used the complete set of 17 baseline features provided by the workshop organisers.</S>
          <S ID="S-49522">Additionally, the UU best system also contained all the features presented by <REF ID="R-05" RPTR="6">Hardmeier (2011)</REF> with the exception</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-49523">of a few features specific to the film subtitle genre and inapplicable to the text type of the shared task, as well as a small number of features not included in that work.</S>
          <S ID="S-49524">Many of these features were modelled on QE features described by <REF ID="R-14" RPTR="19">Specia et al. (2009)</REF>.</S>
          <S ID="S-49525">In particular, the following features were included in addition to the baseline feature set:</S>

          <S ID="S-49543">We did not make any attempt to reduce feature overlap and relied on the learning algorithm for feature selection.</S>

        <HEADER>2.2 Parse trees</HEADER>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-49544">Both the English input text and the Spanish Machine Translations were annotated with syntactic parse trees from which to derive implicit features.</S>
          <S ID="S-49545">In English, we were able to produce both constituency and dependency parses.</S>
          <S ID="S-49546">In Spanish, we were limited to dependency parses because of the better availability of parsing models.</S>
          <S ID="S-49547">English constituency parses were produced with the Stanford parser (<REF ID="R-09" RPTR="11">Klein and Manning, 2003</REF>) using the model bundled with the parser.</S>
          <S ID="S-49548">For dependency parsing, we used MaltParser (<REF ID="R-12" RPTR="18">Nivre et al., 2006</REF>).</S>
          <S ID="S-49549">POS tagging was done with HunPOS (<REF ID="R-04" RPTR="4">Hal&#225;csy et al., 2007</REF>) for English and SVMTool (<REF ID="R-03" RPTR="3">Gim&#233;nez and M&#225;rquez, 2004</REF>) for Spanish, with the models provided by the OPUS project (Tiedemann, 2009).</S>
          <S ID="S-49550">As in previous work (Hardmeier, 2011), we treated the parser as a black box and made no attempt to handle the fact that parsing accuracy may be decreased over malformed SMT output.</S>
          <S ID="S-49551">To be used with tree kernels, the output of the dependency parser had to be transformed into a single tree structure with a unique label per node and unlabelled edges, similar to a constituency parse tree.</S>
          <S ID="S-49552">We followed <REF ID="R-08" RPTR="10">Johansson and Moschitti (2010)</REF> in using a tree representation which encodes partof-speech tags, dependency relations and words as sequences of child nodes (see fig.</S>
          <S ID="S-49553">1).</S>

          <S ID="S-49555">Predicted scores less than 1 were set to 1 and predicted scores greater than 5 were set to 5 as this was known to be the range of valid scores.</S>
          <S ID="S-49556">Our learning algorithm had some free hyperparameters.</S>
          <S ID="S-49557">Three of them were optimised by joint grid search with 5-fold cross-validation over the training set: the SVM training error/margin trade-off (C parameter), one free parameter of the explicit feature kernel and the ratio between explicit feature and tree kernels (see below).</S>
          <S ID="S-49558">All other parameters were left at their default values.</S>
          <S ID="S-49559">Before running it over the test set, the system was retrained on the complete training set using the parameters found with crossvalidation.</S>

      <P>
        <S ID="S-49594">We used two different types of tree kernels for the different types of parse trees (see fig.</S>
        <S ID="S-49595">2).</S>
        <S ID="S-49596">The Subset Tree Kernel (<REF ID="R-02" RPTR="2">Collins and Duffy, 2001</REF>) considers tree fragments consisting of more than one node with the restriction that if one child of a node is included, then all its siblings must be included as well so that the underlying production rule is completely represented.</S>
        <S ID="S-49597">This kind of kernel is well suited for constituency parse trees and was used for the source language constituency parses.</S>
        <S ID="S-49598">For the dependency trees, we used the Partial Tree Kernel (<REF ID="R-10" RPTR="12">Moschitti, 2006</REF><REF ID="R-11" RPTR="15">Moschitti, 2006</REF>a) instead.</S>
        <S ID="S-49599">It extends the Subset Tree Kernel by permitting also the extraction of tree fragments comprising only part of the children of any given node.</S>
        <S ID="S-49600">Lifting this restriction makes sense for dependency trees since a node and its children do not correspond to a grammatical production in a dependency tree in the same way as they do in a constituency tree (<REF ID="R-10" RPTR="13">Moschitti, 2006</REF><REF ID="R-11" RPTR="16">Moschitti, 2006</REF>a).</S>
        <S ID="S-49601">It was used for the dependency trees in the source and in the target language.</S>

        <S ID="S-49602">The explicit feature kernel and the three tree kernels were combined additively, with a single weight parameter to balance the sum of the tree kernels against the explicit feature kernel.</S>
        <S ID="S-49603">This coefficient was optimised together with the other two hyperparameters mentioned above.</S>
        <S ID="S-49604">It turned out that best results could be obtained with a fairly low weight for the tree kernels, but in the cross-validation experiments adding tree kernels did give an improvement over not having them at all.</S>

        <S ID="S-49609">We use the same learning algorithm, so this seems to indicate that the kernel and the hyperparameters they selected worked slightly better than our choices.</S>
        <S ID="S-49610">Using only tree kernels with no explicit features at all (e) creates a system that works considerably worse under crossvalidation, however we note that its performance on the test set is very close to that of system (d).</S>
        <S ID="S-49611">Adding the 82 additional features of <REF ID="R-05" RPTR="8">Hardmeier (2011)</REF> to the system without tree kernels slightly improves the performance both under cross-validation and on the test set (c).</S>
        <S ID="S-49612">Adding tree kernels has a similar effect, which is a bit less pronounced for the cross-validation setting, but quite comparable on the test set (UU bltk, b).</S>
        <S ID="S-49613">Finally, combining the full feature set with tree kernels results in an additional gain under cross-validation, but unfortunately the improvement does not carry over to the test set (UU best, a).</S>

      <HEADER>5 Conclusions</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-49614">In sum, the results confirm the findings made in our earlier work (Hardmeier, 2011).</S>
        <S ID="S-49615">They show that tree kernels can be a valuable tool to boost the initial 112 performance of a Quality Estimation system without spending much effort on feature engineering.</S>
        <S ID="S-49616">Unfortunately, it seems that the gains achieved by tree kernels over simple parse trees and by the additional explicit features used in our systems do not necessarily add up.</S>
        <S ID="S-49617">Nevertheless, comparison with other participating systems shows that either of them is sufficient for state-of-the-art performance.</S>
