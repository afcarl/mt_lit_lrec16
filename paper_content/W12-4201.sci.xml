      <P>
        <S ID="S-51720">Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is the task of identifying the sense of words in texts by reference to some pre-existing sense inventory.</S>
        <S ID="S-51721">The selection of the appropriate inventory and WSD method strongly depends on the goal WSD intends to serve: recent methods are increasingly oriented towards the disambiguation needs of specific end applications, and explicitly aim at improving the overall performance of complex Natural Language Processing systems (<REF ID="R-09" RPTR="19">Ide and Wilks, 2007</REF>; <REF ID="R-03" RPTR="8">Carpuat and Wu, 2007</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-51722">This task-oriented conception of WSD is manifested in the area of multilingual semantic processing: supervised methods, which were previously shown to give the best results, are being abandoned in favor of unsupervised ones that do not rely on preannotated training data.</S>
        <S ID="S-51723">Accordingly, pre-defined semantic inventories, that usually served to provide the lists of candidate word senses, are being replaced by senses relevant to the considered applications and directly identified from corpora by means of word sense induction methods.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-51724">In a multilingual setting, the sense inventories needed for disambiguation are generally built from all possible translations of words or phrases in a parallel corpus (<REF ID="R-03" RPTR="9">Carpuat and Wu, 2007</REF>; <REF ID="R-04" RPTR="11">Chan et al., 2007</REF>), or by using more complex representations of the semantics of translations (<REF ID="R-01" RPTR="1">Apidianaki, 2009</REF>; <REF ID="R-15" RPTR="24">Mihalcea et al., 2010</REF>; <REF ID="R-11" RPTR="21">Lefever and Hoste, 2010</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-51725">However, integrating this semantic knowledge into Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) raises several challenges: the way in which the predictions of the WSD classifier have to be taken into account; the type of context exploited for disambiguation; the target words to be disambiguated (&#8220;all-words&#8221; WSD vs. WSD restricted to target words satisfying specific criteria); the use of a single classifier versus building separate classifiers for each source word; the quantity and type of data used for training the classifier (e.g., use of raw data or of more abstract representations, such as lemmatization, allowing to deal with sparseness issues), and many others.</S>
        <S ID="S-51726">Seemingly, the optimal way to take advantage of WSD predictions remains an open issue.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-51727">In this work, we carry out a set of experiments to investigate the impact of integrating the predictions of a cross-lingual WSD classifier into an SMT system, at two different stages of the translation process.</S>
        <S ID="S-51728">The first approach exploits the probability distribution built by the WSD classifier over the set of translations of words found in the parallel corpus,</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-51729">for reranking the translations in the n-best list generated by the SMT system.</S>
        <S ID="S-51730">Words in the list that match one of the proposed translations are boosted and are thus more likely to appear in the final translation.</S>
        <S ID="S-51731">Our results on the English-French IWSLT&#8217;11 task show substantial improvements in translation quality.</S>
        <S ID="S-51732">The second approach provides a tighter integration of the WSD classifier with the rest of the system: using the WSD predictions, an additional sentence specific language model is estimated and used during decoding.</S>
        <S ID="S-51733">These additional local models can be used as an external knowledge source to reinforce translation hypotheses matching the prediction of the WSD system.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-51734">In the rest of the paper, we present related work on integrating semantic information into SMT (Section 2).</S>
        <S ID="S-51735">The WSD classifier used in the current study is described in Section 3.</S>
        <S ID="S-51736">We then present the two approaches adopted for integrating the WSD output into SMT (Section 4).</S>
        <S ID="S-51737">Evaluation results are presented in Section 5, before concluding and discussing some avenues for future work.</S>

      <P>
        <S ID="S-51738">Word sense disambiguation systems generally work at the word level: given an input word and its context, they predict its (most likely) meaning.</S>
        <S ID="S-51739">At the same time, state-of-the-art translation systems all consider groups of words (phrases, tuples, etc.) rather than single words in the translation process.</S>
        <S ID="S-51740">This discrepancy between the units used in MT and those used in WSD is one of the major difficulties in integrating word predictions into the decoder.</S>
        <S ID="S-51741">This was, for instance, one of the reasons for the somewhat disappointing results obtained by <REF ID="R-02" RPTR="5">Carpuat and Wu (2005)</REF> when the output of a WSD system was directly incorporated into a Chinese-English SMT system.</S>
        <S ID="S-51742">Because of this difficulty, other crosslingual semantics works have considered only simplified tasks, like blank-filling, without addressing the integration of the WSD models in full-scale MT systems (Vickrey et al., 2005; <REF ID="R-22" RPTR="29">Specia, 2006</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-51743">Since the pioneering work of <REF ID="R-02" RPTR="6">Carpuat and Wu (2005)</REF>, several more successful ways to take WSD predictions into account have been proposed.</S>
        <S ID="S-51744">For instance, <REF ID="R-03" RPTR="7">Carpuat and Wu (2007)</REF> proposed to generalize the WSD system so that it performs a fully phrasal multiword disambiguation.</S>
        <S ID="S-51745">However, given that the number of phrases is far larger than the number of words, this approach suffers from sparsity and computational problems, as it requires training a classifier for each entry of the phrase table.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-51746"><REF ID="R-04" RPTR="10">Chan et al. (2007)</REF> introduced a way to modify the rule weights of a hierarchical translation system to reflect the predictions of their WSD system.</S>
        <S ID="S-51747">While their approach and ours are built on the same intuition (an adaptation of a model to incorporate word predictions) their work is specific to hierarchical systems, while ours can be applied to any decoder that uses a language model.</S>
        <S ID="S-51748"><REF ID="R-07" RPTR="18">Haque et al. (2009)</REF> et Haque et al. (2010) introduce lexico-syntactic descriptions in the form of supertags as source language context-informed features in a phrase-based SMT and a state-of-the-art hierarchical model, respectively, and report significant gains in translation quality.</S>

      <P>
        <S ID="S-51749">Closer to our work, <REF ID="R-13" RPTR="22">Mauser et al. (2009)</REF> and <REF ID="R-19" RPTR="26">Patry and Langlais (2011)</REF> train a global lexicon model that predicts the bag of output words from the bag of input words.</S>
        <S ID="S-51750">As no explicit alignment between input and output words is used, words are chosen based on the (global) input context.</S>
        <S ID="S-51751">For each input sentence, the decoder considers these word predictions as an additional feature that it uses to define a new model score which favors translation hypotheses containing words predicted by the global lexicon model.</S>
        <S ID="S-51752">A difference between this approach and our work is that instead of using a global lexicon model, we disambiguate a subset of the words in the input sentence by employing a WSD classifier that creates a probability distribution over the translations of each word in its context.</S>
        <S ID="S-51753">The unsupervised cross-lingual WSD classifier used in this work is similar to the one proposed in <REF ID="R-01" RPTR="2">Apidianaki (2009)</REF>.</S>
        <S ID="S-51754">The original classifier disambiguates new instances of words in context by selecting the most appropriate cluster of translations among a set of candidate clusters found in an automatically built bilingual sense inventory.</S>
        <S ID="S-51755">The sense inventory exploited by the classifier is created by a cross-lingual word sense induction (WSI) method that reveals the senses of source words by grouping their translations into clusters according to their semantic proximity, revealed by a distributional similarity calculation.</S>
        <S ID="S-51756">The resulting clusters represent</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-51757">the source words&#8217; candidate senses.</S>
        <S ID="S-51758">This WSD method gave good results in a word prediction task but, similarly to the work of Vickrey et al. (2005) and of <REF ID="R-22" RPTR="30">Specia (2006)</REF>, the predictions are not integrated into a complete MT system.</S>

          <S ID="S-51827">For instance, the unigram probabilities of the additional LM can be derived from the (word) predictions of a WSD system, bigram probabilities from the prediction of phrases and so on and so forth.</S>

        <P>
          <S ID="S-51829">is, to the best of our knowledge, the first time it is experimentally validated.</S>
          <S ID="S-51830">In practice, the predictions of the WSD system described in Section 3 can be integrated by defining, for each sentence, an additional unigram language model as follows:</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-51831">&#8226; each translation predicted by the WSD classifier can be generated by the language model with the probability estimated by the WSD classifier; no information about the source word that has been disambiguated is considered;</S>

        <P>
          <S ID="S-51833">Even if most of the words composing the translation hypothesis are considered as unknown words, hypotheses that contain the words predicted by the WSD system still have a higher LM score and are therefore preferred.</S>
          <S ID="S-51834">Note that even if we only use unigram language models in our experiments, as senses are predicted at the word level, our approach is able to handle disambiguation of phrases as well.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-51835">This approach has two main advantages over existing ways to integrate WSD predictions in an SMT system.</S>
          <S ID="S-51836">First, no hard decisions are made: errors of the WSD can be &#8220;corrected&#8221; by the translation.</S>
          <S ID="S-51837">Second, sense disambiguation at the word level is naturally and automatically propagated at the phrase level: the additional LM is influencing all phrase pairs using one of the predicted words.</S>
          <S ID="S-51838">Compared to the reranking approach introduced in the previous section, this method results in a tighter integration with the decoder.</S>
          <S ID="S-51839">In particular, the WSD predictions are applied before searchspace pruning and are therefore expected to have a more important role.</S>

          <S ID="S-51849">We used the Moses decoder (<REF ID="R-10" RPTR="20">Koehn et al., 2007</REF>).</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-51850">The TED-talk corpus is a small data set made of a monolingual corpus (111, 431 sentences) used to estimate a 4-gram language model with KNsmoothing, and a bilingual corpus (107, 268 sentences) used to extract the phrase table.</S>
          <S ID="S-51851">All data are tokenized, cleaned and converted to lowercase letters using the tools provided by the WMT organizers.</S>
          <S ID="S-51852">7 We then use a standard training pipeline to construct the translation model: the bitext is aligned using GIZA++, symmetrized using the grow-diagfinal-and heuristic; the phrase table is extracted and scored using the tools distributed with Moses.</S>

          <S ID="S-51856">The first one uses the IBM 1 model estimated during the SMT system training as a simple WSD system: for each source sentence, a unigram additional language model is defined by taking, for each source, the 20 best translations according to the IBM 1 model and their probability.</S>
          <S ID="S-51857">Model 1 has been shown to be one of the best performing features to be added to an SMT system in a reranking step (Och et al., 2004) and can be seen as a naive WSD classifier.</S>
          <S ID="S-51858">To test the validity of our approach, we replicate the &#8220;oracle&#8221; experiments of <REF ID="R-05" RPTR="13">Crego et al. (2010)</REF> and estimate the best gain our method can achieve.</S>
          <S ID="S-51859">These experiments consist in using the reference to train a local n-gram language model (with n in the range 1 to 3) which amounts, in the local language model method of Section 4.2, to assuming that the WSD system correctly predicted a single translation for each source word.</S>

          <S ID="S-51861">It appears that, for the considered task, sense disambiguation improves translation performance: n-best rescoring results in a 0.37 BLEU improvement and using an additional language model brings about an improvement of up to a 0.88 BLEU.</S>

          <S ID="S-51865">When rescoring n-best, an improvement is observed only when the weights are initialized to zero and not to the weights resulting from the previous optimization, maybe because of the difficulty to exit the local minimum MERT had found earlier.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-51866">As expected, integrating the WSD predictions with an additional language model results in a larger improvement than simple rescoring, which shows the importance of applying this new source of information early in the translation pipeline, before search space pruning.</S>
          <S ID="S-51867">Also note that the system using the IBM 1 predictions is outperformed by the system using the WSD classifier introduced in Section 3, showing the quality of its predictions.</S>

          <S ID="S-51869">It must, however, be noted that contrary to the WSD method introduced in Section 3, these oracle experiments rely on sense predictions for all source words and not only content words.</S>

          <S ID="S-51874">The method permits to compare the results produced by the systems on different word classes and to take into account the source words that were actually translated.</S>
          <S ID="S-51875">We focus this evaluation on the classes of content words (nouns, adjectives, verbs and adverbs) on which WSD had an important coverage.</S>
          <S ID="S-51876">Our aim is, first, to explore how these words are handled by a WSDinformed SMT system (the system using the local language models) compared to the baseline system that does not exploit any semantic information; and, second, to investigate whether their disambiguation influences the translation of surrounding non-disambiguated words.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-51877">Table 3 reports the percentage of words correctly translated by the semantically-informed system within each content word class: consistent gains in translation quality are observed for all parts-ofspeech compared to the baseline, and the best results are obtained for nouns.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-51878">Table 4 shows how the words surrounding a disambiguated word w (noun, verb, adjective or adverb) in the text are handled by the two systems.</S>
          <S ID="S-51879">More precisely, we look at the translation of words in the immediate context of w, i.e. at positions w &#8722;2 , w &#8722;1 , w +1 and w +2 .</S>
          <S ID="S-51880">The left column reports the percentage of correct translations produced by the baseline system (without disambiguation) for words in these positions; the right column shows the positive impact that the disambiguation of a word has on the translation of its neighbors.</S>
          <S ID="S-51881">Note that this time we look at disambiguated words and their context without evaluating the correctness of the WSD predictions.</S>
          <S ID="S-51882">Nevertheless, even in this case, consistent gains are observed when WSD information is exploited.</S>
          <S ID="S-51883">For instance, when a noun is disambiguated, 70.46% and 76.3% of the immediately preceding (w &#8722;1 ) and following (w +1 ) words, respectively, are correctly translated, versus 68.69% and 75.17% of correct translations produced by the baseline system.</S>

      <P>
        <S ID="S-51885">The preliminary results presented in this paper on integrating cross-lingual WSD into a state-of-theart SMT system are encouraging.</S>
        <S ID="S-51886">Both adopted approaches (n-best rescoring and local language modeling) benefit from the predictions of the proposed cross-lingual WSD classifier.</S>
        <S ID="S-51887">The contrastive evaluation results further show that WSD improves not only the translation of disambiguated words, but also the translation of neighboring words in the input texts.</S>
        <S ID="S-51888">We consider various ways for extending this work.</S>
        <S ID="S-51889">First, future experiments will involve the use of more abstract representations of senses than individual translations, by applying a cross-lingual word sense induction method to the training corpus prior to disambiguation.</S>
        <S ID="S-51890">We will also experiment with disambiguation at the level of lemmas, to reduce sparseness issues, and with different ways for handling lemmatized predictions by the SMT systems.</S>
        <S ID="S-51891">Furthermore, we intend to extend the coverage of the WSD method by exploring other filtering methods for cleaning the alignment lexicons, and by addressing the disambiguation of words of all PoS.</S>
