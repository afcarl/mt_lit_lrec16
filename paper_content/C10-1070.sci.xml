      <HEADER>1 Introduction</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-803">Identifying translations of terms in comparable corpora is a challenge that has attracted many researchers.</S>
        <S ID="S-804">A popular idea that emerged for solving this problem is based on the assumption that the context of a term and its translation share similarities that can be used to rank translation candidates (<REF ID="R-07" RPTR="27">Fung, 1998</REF>; <REF ID="R-13" RPTR="40">Rapp, 1999</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-805">Many variants of this idea have been implemented.</S>
        <S ID="S-806">While a few studies have investigated pattern matching approaches to compare source and target contexts (<REF ID="R-06" RPTR="25">Fung, 1995</REF>; <REF ID="R-03" RPTR="22">Diab and Finch, 2000</REF>; <REF ID="R-19" RPTR="53">Yu and Tsujii, 2009</REF>), most variants make use of a bilingual lexicon in order to translate the words of the context of a term (often called seed words).</S>
        <S ID="S-807"><REF ID="R-02" RPTR="17">D&#233;jean et al. (2005)</REF> instead use a bilingual thesaurus for translating these.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-808">Another distinction between approaches lies in the way the context is defined.</S>
        <S ID="S-809">The most common practice, the so-called window-based approach, defines the context words as those cooccuring significantly with the source term within windows centered around the term.</S>
        <S ID="S-810">1 Some studies have reported gains by considering syntactically motivated co-occurrences.</S>
        <S ID="S-811">Yu and Tsujii (2009) propose a resource-intensive strategy which requires both source and target dependency parsers, while <REF ID="R-21" RPTR="59">Otero (2007)</REF><REF ID="R-22" RPTR="60">(2007)</REF> investigates a lighter approach where a few hand coded regular expressions based on POS tags simulate source parsing.</S>
        <S ID="S-812">The latter approach only requires a POS tagger of the source and the target languages as well as a small parallel corpus in order to project the source regular expressions.</S>
        <S ID="S-813">Naturally, studies differ in the way each cooccurrence (either window or syntax-based) is weighted, and a plethora of association scores have been investigated and compared, the likelihood score (<REF ID="R-04" RPTR="23">Dunning, 1993</REF>) being among the most popular.</S>
        <S ID="S-814">Also, different similarity measures have been proposed for ranking target context vectors, among which the popular cosine measure.</S>
        <S ID="S-815">The goal of the different authors who investigate context-projection approaches also varies.</S>
        <S ID="S-816">Some studies are tackling the problem of identifying the translation of general words (<REF ID="R-13" RPTR="41">Rapp, 1999</REF>; Otero, 2007; <REF ID="R-19" RPTR="54">Yu and Tsujii, 2009</REF>) while others are addressing the translation of domain specific terms.</S>
        <S ID="S-817">Among the latter, many are translating single-word terms (<REF ID="R-00" RPTR="1">Chiao and Zweigenbaum, 2002</REF>; <REF ID="R-02" RPTR="18">D&#233;jean et al., 2005</REF>; Prochasson et</S>

        <S ID="S-819">words from populating the context vectors.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-820">al., 2009), while others are tackling the translation of multi-word terms (<REF ID="R-01" RPTR="6">Daille and Morin, 2005</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-821">The type of discourse might as well be of concern in some of the studies dedicated to bilingual terminology mining.</S>
        <S ID="S-822">For instance, <REF ID="R-11" RPTR="34">Morin et al. (2007)</REF><REF ID="R-22" RPTR="61">(2007)</REF> distinguish popular science versus scientific terms, while <REF ID="R-15" RPTR="49">Saralegi et al. (2008)</REF> target popular science terms only.</S>
        <S ID="S-823">The present discussion only focuses on a few number of representative studies.</S>
        <S ID="S-824">Still, it is already striking that a direct comparison of them is difficult, if not impossible.</S>
        <S ID="S-825">Differences in resources being used (in quantities, in domains, etc.), in technical choices made (similarity measures, context vector computation, etc.) and in objectives (general versus terminological dictionary extraction) prevent one from establishing a clear landscape of the various approaches.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-826">Indeed, many studies provide some figures that help to appreciate the influence of some parameters in a given experimental setting.</S>
        <S ID="S-827">Notably, Otero (2008) studies no less than 7 similarity measures for ranking context vectors while comparing window and syntax-based methods.</S>
        <S ID="S-828"><REF ID="R-11" RPTR="35">Morin et al. (2007)</REF><REF ID="R-22" RPTR="62">(2007)</REF> consider both the log-likelihood and the mutual information association scores as well as the Jaccard and the cosine similarity measures.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-829">Ideally, a benchmark on which researchers could run their translation finder would ease the comparison of the different approaches.</S>
        <S ID="S-830">However, designing such a benchmark that would satisfy the evaluation purposes of all the researchers is far too ambitious a goal for this contribution.</S>
        <S ID="S-831">Instead, we investigate the impact of some major factors influencing projection-based approaches on a task of translating 5,000 terms of the medical domain (the most studied domain), making use of French and English Wikipedia pages extracted monolingually thanks to an information retrieval engine.</S>
        <S ID="S-832">While the present work does not investigate all the parameters that could potentially impact results, we believe it constitutes the most complete and systematic comparison made so far with variants of the context-based projection approach.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-833">In the remainder of this paper, we describe the projection-based approach to translation spotting in Section 2 and detail the parameters that directly influence its performance.</S>
        <S ID="S-834">The experimental protocol we followed is described in Section 3 and we analyze our results in Section 4.</S>
        <S ID="S-835">We discuss the main results in the light of previous work and propose some future avenues in Section 5.</S>

      <HEADER>2 Projection-based variants</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-900">The approach we investigate for identifying term translations in comparable corpora is similar to (<REF ID="R-13" RPTR="42">Rapp, 1999</REF>) and many others.</S>
        <S ID="S-901">We describe in the following the different steps it encompasses and the parameters we are considering in the light of typical choices made in the literature.</S>
      </P>
      <DIV DEPTH="1">
        <HEADER>2.1 Approach</HEADER>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-836">Step 1 A comparable corpus is constructed for each term to translate.</S>
          <S ID="S-837">In this study, the source and target corpora are sets of Wikipedia pages related to the source term (S) and its reference translation (T ) respectively (see Section 3.1).</S>
          <S ID="S-838">The degree of corpus preprocessing varies greatly from one study to another.</S>
          <S ID="S-839">Complex linguistic tools such as terminological extractors (<REF ID="R-01" RPTR="7">Daille and Morin, 2005</REF>), parsers (<REF ID="R-19" RPTR="55">Yu and Tsujii, 2009</REF>) or lemmatizers (<REF ID="R-13" RPTR="43">Rapp, 1999</REF>) are sometimes used.</S>
          <S ID="S-840">In our case, the only preprocessing that takes place is the deletion of the Wikipedia symbols pertaining to its particular syntax (e.g. [[ ]]).</S>
          <S ID="S-841">2 It is to be noted that, for the sake of simplicity and generality, our implementation does not exploit interlanguage links nor structural elements specific to Wikipedia documents, as opposed to (<REF ID="R-19" RPTR="56">Yu and Tsujii, 2009</REF>).</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-842">Step 2 A context vector v s for the source term S is built (see Figure 1 for a made-up example).</S>
          <S ID="S-843">This vector contains the words that are in the context of the occurrences of S and are strongly correlated to S.</S>
          <S ID="S-844">The definition of &#8220;context&#8221; is one of the parameters whose best value we want to find.</S>
          <S ID="S-845">Context length can be based on a number of units, for instance 3 sentences (<REF ID="R-01" RPTR="8">Daille and Morin, 2005</REF>), windows of 3 (<REF ID="R-13" RPTR="44">Rapp, 1999</REF>) or 25 words (<REF ID="R-12" RPTR="36">Prochasson et al., 2009</REF>), etc. It is an important parameter of the projection-based approach.</S>
          <S ID="S-846">Should the context length be too small, we would miss words that would be relevant in finding the translation.</S>
          <S ID="S-847">On the other hand, if the context is too large, it</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-848">2 We used a set of about 40 regular expressions to do this.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-849">might contain too much noise.</S>
          <S ID="S-850">At this step, a stoplist made of function words is applied in order to filter out context words and reduce noise in the context vector.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-851">Additionally, an association measure is used to score the strength of correlation between S and the words in its contexts; it serves to normalize corpus frequencies.</S>
          <S ID="S-852">Words that have a high association score with S are more prominent in the context vector.</S>
          <S ID="S-853">The association measure is the second important parameter we want to study.</S>
          <S ID="S-854">As already noted, most authors use the log-likelihood ratio to measure the association between collocates; some, like (<REF ID="R-13" RPTR="45">Rapp, 1999</REF>), informally compare the performance of a small number of association measures, or combine the results obtained with different association measures (<REF ID="R-01" RPTR="9">Daille and Morin, 2005</REF>).</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-855">Step 4 Context vectors v t are computed for each candidate term in the target language corpus (Figure 3).</S>
          <S ID="S-856">The dimension of the target-vector space is defined to be the one induced by the projection mechanism described in Step 3.</S>
          <S ID="S-857">The context vector v t of each candidate term is computed as in Step 2.</S>
          <S ID="S-858">Therefore, in Step 4, the parameters of context definition and association measure are important and take the same values as those in Step 2.</S>
          <S ID="S-859">Note that in this study, on top of all single terms, we also consider target bigrams as potential candidates (99.5 % of our reference target terms are composed of at most two words).</S>
          <S ID="S-860">As such, our method can handle complex terms (of up to two words), as opposed to most previous studies, without having to resort to a separate terminological extraction as in (<REF ID="R-01" RPTR="10">Daille and Morin, 2005</REF>).</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-861">Step 3 Words in v s are projected into the target language with the help of the bilingual seed lexicon (Figure 2).</S>
          <S ID="S-862">Each word in v s which is present in the bilingual lexicon is translated, and those translations define the projected context vector v p .</S>
          <S ID="S-863">Words that are not found in the bilingual lexicon are simply ignored.</S>
          <S ID="S-864">The size of the seed lexicon and its content are therefore two important parameters of the approach.</S>
          <S ID="S-865">In previous studies, seed lexicons vary between 16,000 (<REF ID="R-13" RPTR="46">Rapp, 1999</REF>) and 65,000 (<REF ID="R-02" RPTR="19">D&#233;jean et al., 2005</REF>) entries, a typical size being around 20,000 (<REF ID="R-07" RPTR="28">Fung, 1998</REF>; <REF ID="R-00" RPTR="2">Chiao and Zweigenbaum, 2002</REF>; <REF ID="R-01" RPTR="11">Daille and Morin, 2005</REF>).</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-866">Step 5 Context vectors v t are ranked in decreasing order of their similarity with v p (Figure 4).</S>
          <S ID="S-867">The similarity measure between context vectors varies among studies: city-block measure (<REF ID="R-13" RPTR="47">Rapp, 1999</REF>), cosine (<REF ID="R-07" RPTR="29">Fung, 1998</REF>; <REF ID="R-00" RPTR="3">Chiao and Zweigenbaum, 2002</REF>; <REF ID="R-01" RPTR="12">Daille and Morin, 2005</REF>; <REF ID="R-12" RPTR="37">Prochasson et al., 2009</REF>), Dice or Jaccard indexes (<REF ID="R-00" RPTR="4">Chiao and Zweigenbaum, 2002</REF>; <REF ID="R-01" RPTR="13">Daille and Morin, 2005</REF>), etc. It is among the parameters whose effect we experimentally evaluate.</S>

      <P>
        <S ID="S-1024">Our results show that using the log-odds ratio as the association measure allows for significantly better translation spotting than the log-likelihood.</S>
        <S ID="S-1025">A closer look at the translation candidates obtained when using LL, the most popular association measure in projection-based approaches, shows that they are often collocates of the reference translation.</S>
        <S ID="S-1026">Therefore, LL may fare better in an indirect approach, like the one in (<REF ID="R-01" RPTR="15">Daille and Morin, 2005</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-1027">Moreover, we have seen that the cosine similarity measure and sentence contexts give more correct top translation candidates, at least when LO is used.</S>
        <S ID="S-1028">Indeed, the values of the different parameters influence one another in most cases.</S>
        <S ID="S-1029">Parameters related to the seed lexicon (size, domain specificity) are not of great influence on the performance, but this may in part be due to our resources and the way they were built.</S>
        <S ID="S-1030">The highest Top 1 precision, 55.2 %, was reached with the following parameters: sentence contexts, LO, cosine and a 9,000-entry mixed lexicon, with the use of a cognate heuristic.</S>
        <S ID="S-1031">In future works, other parameters which influence the performance will be studied, among which the use of a terminological extractor to treat complex terms (<REF ID="R-01" RPTR="16">Daille and Morin, 2005</REF>), more contextual window configurations, and the use of syntactic information in combination with lexical information (<REF ID="R-19" RPTR="57">Yu and Tsujii, 2009</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-1032">It would also be interesting to compare the projection-based approaches to (<REF ID="R-08" RPTR="31">Haghighi et al., 2008</REF>)&#8217;s generative model for bilingual lexicon acquisition from monolingual corpora.</S>
        <S ID="S-1033">One latent outcome of this work is that Wikipedia is surprisingly suitable for mining medical terms.</S>
        <S ID="S-1034">We plan to check its adequacy for other domains and verify that LO remains a better association measure for different corpora and domains.</S>
