      <HEADER>1 Introduction</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-42376">Accurate name translation is crucial to many cross-lingual information processing tasks such as information retrieval (e.g. <REF ID="R-05" RPTR="4">Ji et al., 2008</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-42377">Recently there has been heightened interest in discovering name pairs from comparable corpora (e.g. Sproat et al., 2006; <REF ID="R-07" RPTR="6">Klementiev and Roth, 2006</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-42378">By comparable corpora we mean texts that are about similar topics, but are not in general translations of each other.</S>
        <S ID="S-42379">These corpora are naturally available, for example, many news agencies release multi-lingual news articles on the same day.</S>
        <S ID="S-42380">There are no document-level or sentence-level alignments across languages, but important facts such as names, relations and events in one language in such corpora tend to co-occur with their counterparts in the other.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-42381">However, most of the previous approaches used a phonetic similarity based name transliteration module as baseline to generate translation hypotheses, and then exploit the distribution evidence from comparable corpora to re-score these hypotheses.</S>
        <S ID="S-42382">As a result, these approaches are limited to names which are phonetically transliterated (e.g. translate Chinese name &#8220; &#23588; &#30003; &#31185; (You shen ke)&#8221; to &#8220;Yushchenko&#8221; in English).</S>
        <S ID="S-42383">But many other types of names such as organizations are often rendered semantically, for example, the Chinese name &#8220; &#35299; &#25918; &#20043; &#34382; (jie fang zhi hu)&#8221; is translated into &#8220;Liberation Tiger&#8221; in English.</S>
        <S ID="S-42384">Furthermore, many name translations are context dependent.</S>
        <S ID="S-42385">For example, a person name &#8220; &#20122; &#35199; &#23572; &#183; &#38463; &#25289; &#27861; &#29305; &#8221; should be translated into &#8220;Yasser Arafat (PLO Chairman)&#8221; or &#8220;Yasir Arafat (Cricketer)&#8221; based on different contexts.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-42386">Information extraction (IE) techniques &#8211; identifying important entities, relations and events &#8211; are currently available for some non-English languages.</S>
        <S ID="S-42387">In this paper we define a new notion &#8216;bilingual information networks&#8217; which can be extracted from comparable corpora.</S>
        <S ID="S-42388">An information network is a set of directed graphs, in which each node is a named entity and the nodes are linked by various &#8216;attributes&#8217; such as hometown, employer, spouse etc.</S>
        <S ID="S-42389">Then we align the information networks in two languages automatically in a bootstrapping way to discover name translation pairs.</S>
        <S ID="S-42390">For example, after we extract bilingual</S>

      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-42393">information networks as shown in Figure 1, we can start from a common name translation &#8220; &#22269; &#23478; &#24773; &#25253; &#23616; -National Intelligence Service (1)&#8221;, to align its leader as &#8220; &#33945; &#29305; &#35199; &#35834; &#26031; - Montesinos (2)&#8221;, align the arrest place of Montesinos as &#8220; &#21345; &#35199; &#20420; -Callao (3)&#8221;, and then align the location of Callao as &#8220; &#31192; &#40065; -Peru (4)&#8221;.</S>
        <S ID="S-42394">Using this approach we can discover name pairs of various types (person, organization and location) while minimizing using supervised name transliteration techniques.</S>
        <S ID="S-42395">At the same time, we can provide links among names for entity disambiguation.</S>

        <P>
          <S ID="S-42451">One major evidence exploited in the prior work is that the bilingual comparable corpora should be weakly temporally aligned.</S>
          <S ID="S-42452">For example, <REF ID="R-07" RPTR="5">Klementiev and Roth (2006)</REF> used the time distribution of names to re-score name transliteration.</S>

          <S ID="S-42458">In addition, in order to measure the impact of news source similarity, we apply our approach to the combination of CHSet3 and ENSet4 which are from different news agencies.</S>
          <S ID="S-42459">In total 815 name pairs are discovered after 4 iterations with overall accuracy 78.7%, which is worse than the results from the corpora of the same news source as shown in Table 4.</S>

        <S ID="S-42469">Our approach of extracting and aligning information network from comparable corpora is related to some prior work using comparable corpora to rescore name transliterations (Sproat et al., 2006; <REF ID="R-07" RPTR="7">Klementiev and Roth, 2006</REF>).</S>

      <HEADER>7 Conclusion and Future Work</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-42473">We have described a simple approach to create bilingual information networks and then discover name pairs from comparable corpora.</S>
        <S ID="S-42474">The experiments on Chinese and English have shown that this method can generate name translation pairs with high accuracy by using a small seed set.</S>
        <S ID="S-42475">In the short term, our approach will provide a framework for many byproducts and directly benefit other NLP tasks.</S>
        <S ID="S-42476">For example, the aligned sub-graphs with names, relations and events can be used to improve information redundancy in cross-lingual question answering; the outlier (mis-aligned) sub-graphs can be used to detect the novel or local information described in one language but not in the other.</S>
        <S ID="S-42477">In the future we plan to import more efficient graph mining and alignment algorithms which have been widely used for protein-protein interaction detection (Kelley et al., 2003).</S>
        <S ID="S-42478">In addition, we will attempt using unsupervised relation extraction based on lexical semantics to replace the supervised IE pipeline.</S>
        <S ID="S-42479">More importantly, we will investigate the tradeoff between coverage and accuracy by applying the generated name pairs to cross-lingual name search and machine translation tasks.</S>
