      <HEADER>1 Introduction</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-4317">Linguistic and context features, especially sparse lexical features, have been widely used in recent machine translation (MT) research.</S>
        <S ID="S-4318">Unfortunately, existing methods of using such features are not ideal for large-scale, practical translation tasks.</S>
        <S ID="S-4319">In this paper, we will propose several probabilistic models to effectively exploit linguistic and contextual information for MT decoding, and these new features do not suffer from the scalability problem.</S>
        <S ID="S-4320">Our new models are tested on NIST MT06 and MT08 data, and they provide significant improvement over a strong baseline system.</S>

        <HEADER>1.1 Previous Work</HEADER>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-4259">The ideas of using labels, length preference and source side context in MT decoding were explored previously.</S>
          <S ID="S-4260">Broadly speaking, two approaches were commonly used in existing work.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-4261">One is to use a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or Perceptron like online learning algorithm to optimize the weights of these features directly for MT (<REF ID="R-20" RPTR="32">Shen et al., 2004</REF>; <REF ID="R-14" RPTR="26">Liang et al., 2006</REF>; <REF ID="R-23" RPTR="39">Tillmann and Zhang, 2006</REF>).</S>
          <S ID="S-4262">This method is very attractive, since it opens the door to rich lexical features.</S>
          <S ID="S-4263">However, in order to robustly optimize the feature weights, one has to use a substantially large development set, which results in significantly slower tuning.</S>
          <S ID="S-4264">Alternatively, one needs to carefully select a development set that simulates the test set to reduce the risk of over-fitting, which however is not always realistic for practical use.</S>
          <S ID="S-4265">A remedy is to aggressively limit the feature space, e.g. to syntactic labels or a small fraction of the bi-lingual features available, as in (Chiang et al., 2008; <REF ID="R-04" RPTR="5">Chiang et al., 2009</REF>), but that reduces the benefit of lexical features.</S>
          <S ID="S-4266">A possible generic solution is to cluster the lexical features in some way.</S>
          <S ID="S-4267">However, how to make it work on such a large space of bi-lingual features is still an open question.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-4268">The other approach is to estimate a single score or likelihood of a translation with rich features, for example, with the maximum entropy (Max- Ent) method as in (<REF ID="R-02" RPTR="1">Carpuat and Wu, 2007</REF>; <REF ID="R-12" RPTR="19">Ittycheriah and Roukos, 2007</REF>; <REF ID="R-11" RPTR="12">He et al., 2008</REF>).</S>
          <S ID="S-4269">This method avoids the over-fitting problem, at the expense of losing the benefit of discriminative training of rich features directly for MT.</S>
          <S ID="S-4270">However, the feature space problem still exists in these published models.</S>
          <S ID="S-4271">He et al. (2008) extended the WSD-like approached proposed in (<REF ID="R-02" RPTR="2">Carpuat and Wu, 2007</REF>) to hierarchical decoders.</S>
          <S ID="S-4272">In (<REF ID="R-11" RPTR="13">He et al., 2008</REF>), lexical</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-4273">features were limited on each single side due to the feature space problem.</S>
          <S ID="S-4274">In order to further reduce the complexity of MaxEnt training, they &#8220;trained a MaxEnt model for each ambiguous hierarchical LHS&#8221; (left-hand side or source side) of translation rules.</S>
          <S ID="S-4275">Different target sides were treated as possible labels.</S>
          <S ID="S-4276">Therefore, the sample sets of each individual MaxEnt model were very small, while the number of features could easily exceed the number of samples.</S>
          <S ID="S-4277">Furthermore, optimizing individual MaxEnt models in this way does not lead to global maximum.</S>
          <S ID="S-4278">In addition, MaxEnt models trained on small sets are unstable.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-4279">The MaxEnt model in (<REF ID="R-12" RPTR="20">Ittycheriah and Roukos, 2007</REF>) was optimized globally, so that it could better employ the distribution of the training data.</S>
          <S ID="S-4280">However, one has to filter the training data according to the test data to get competitive performance with this model 1 .</S>
          <S ID="S-4281">In addition, the filtering method causes some practical issues.</S>
          <S ID="S-4282">First, such methods are not suitable for real MT tasks, especially for applications with streamed input, since the model has to be retrained with each new input sentence or document and training is slow.</S>
          <S ID="S-4283">Furthermore, the model is ill-posed.</S>
          <S ID="S-4284">The translation of a source sentence depends on other source sentences in the same batch with which the MaxEnt model is trained.</S>
          <S ID="S-4285">If we add one more sentence to the batch, translations of other sentences may become different due to the change of the MaxEnt model.</S>
          <S ID="S-4286">To sum up, the existing models of employing rich bi-lingual lexical information in MT are imperfect.</S>
          <S ID="S-4287">Many of them are not ideal for practical translation tasks.</S>

        <HEADER>1.2 Our Approach</HEADER>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-4288">As for our approach, we mainly use simple probabilistic models, i.e. Gaussian and n-gram models, which are more robust and suitable for large-scale training of real data, as manifested in state-of-theart systems of speech recognition.</S>
          <S ID="S-4289">The unique contribution of our work is to design effective and efficient statistical models to capture useful linguistic and context information for MT decoding.</S>
          <S ID="S-4290">Feature functions defined in this way are robust and ideal for practical translation tasks.</S>
          <S ID="S-4291">1 According to footnote 2 of (<REF ID="R-12" RPTR="21">Ittycheriah and Roukos, 2007</REF>), test set adaptation by test set sampling of the training corpus showed an advantage of more than 2 BLEU points over a general system trained on all data.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-4292">In this paper, we will introduce four new linguistic and contextual feature functions.</S>
          <S ID="S-4293">Here, we first provide a high-level description of these features.</S>
          <S ID="S-4294">Details of the features are discussed in Section 2.</S>
          <S ID="S-4295">The first feature is based on non-terminal labels, i.e. POS tags of the head words of target nonterminals in transfer rules.</S>
          <S ID="S-4296">This feature reduces the ambiguity of translation rules.</S>
          <S ID="S-4297">The other benefit is that POS tags help to weed out bad target side tree structures, as an enhancement to the target dependency language model.</S>
          <S ID="S-4298">The second feature is based on the length distribution of non-terminals.</S>
          <S ID="S-4299">In English as well as in other languages, the same deep structure can be represented in different syntactic structures depending on the complexity of its constituents.</S>
          <S ID="S-4300">We model such preferences by associating each nonterminal of a transfer rule with a probability distribution over its length.</S>
          <S ID="S-4301">Similar ideas were explored in (<REF ID="R-11" RPTR="14">He et al., 2008</REF>).</S>
          <S ID="S-4302">However their length features only provided insignificant improvement of 0.1 BLEU point.</S>
          <S ID="S-4303">A crucial difference of our approach is how the length preference is modeled.</S>
          <S ID="S-4304">We approximate the length distribution of non-terminals with a smoothed Gaussian, which is more robust and gives rise to much larger improvement consistently.</S>
          <S ID="S-4305">The third feature utilizes source side context information, i.e. the neighboring words of an input span, to influence the selection of the target translation for a span.</S>
          <S ID="S-4306">While the use of context information has been explored in MT, e.g. (<REF ID="R-02" RPTR="3">Carpuat and Wu, 2007</REF>) and (<REF ID="R-11" RPTR="15">He et al., 2008</REF>), the specific technique we used by means of a context language model is rather different.</S>
          <S ID="S-4307">Our model is trained on the whole training data, and it is not limited by the constraint of MaxEnt training.</S>
          <S ID="S-4308">The fourth feature exploits structural information on the source side.</S>
          <S ID="S-4309">Specifically, the decoder simultaneously generates both the source and target side dependency trees, and employs two dependency LMs, one for the source and the other for the target, for scoring translation hypotheses.</S>
          <S ID="S-4310">Our intuition is that the likelihood of source structures provides another piece of evidence about the plausibility of a translation hypothesis and as such would help weed out bad ones.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-4311">We take BBN&#8217;s HierDec, a string-to-dependency decoder as described in (<REF ID="R-21" RPTR="33">Shen et al., 2008</REF>), as our baseline for the following two reasons:</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-4312">to incorporate the features proposed in this paper.</S>
          <S ID="S-4313">The use of source dependency structures is a natural extension of the stringto-tree model to a tree-to-tree model.</S>
          <S ID="S-4314">To ensure the generality of our results, we tested the features on two rather different language pairs, Arabic-to-English and Chinese-to-English, using two metrics, IBM BLEU (<REF ID="R-17" RPTR="29">Papineni et al., 2001</REF>) and TER (<REF ID="R-22" RPTR="38">Snover et al., 2006</REF>).</S>
          <S ID="S-4315">Our experiments show that each of the first three features: nonterminal labels, length distribution and source side context, improves MT performance.</S>
          <S ID="S-4316">Surprisingly, the source dependency feature does not produce an improvement.</S>

        <P>
          <S ID="S-4321">In the original string-to-dependency model (<REF ID="R-21" RPTR="34">Shen et al., 2008</REF>), a translation rule is composed of a string of words and non-terminals on the source side and a well-formed dependency structure on the target side.</S>
          <S ID="S-4322">A well-formed dependency structure could be either a single-rooted dependency tree or a set of sibling trees.</S>
          <S ID="S-4323">As in the Hiero system (<REF ID="R-06" RPTR="7">Chiang, 2007</REF>), there is only one non-terminal X in the string-to-dependency model.</S>
          <S ID="S-4324">Any sub dependency structure can be used to replace a nonterminal in a rule.</S>

          <S ID="S-4333">Since there is no constraint on substitution, any translation for jiantao could replace the X-1 slot.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-4334">One way to alleviate this problem is to limit the search space by using a label system.</S>
          <S ID="S-4335">We could assign a label to each non-terminal on the target side of the rules.</S>
          <S ID="S-4336">Furthermore, we could assign a label to the whole target dependency structure, as shown in Figure 2.</S>
          <S ID="S-4337">In decoding, each target dependency sub-structure would be associated with a label.</S>
          <S ID="S-4338">Whenever substitution happens, we would check whether the label of the sub-structure and the label of the slot are the same.</S>
          <S ID="S-4339">Substitutions with unmatched labels would be prohibited.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-4340">In practice, we use a soft constraint by penalizing substitutions with unmatched labels.</S>
          <S ID="S-4341">We introduce a new feature: the number of times substitutions with unmatched labels appear in the derivation of a translation hypothesis.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-4342">Obviously, to implement this feature we need to associate a label with each non-terminal in the target side of a translation rule.</S>
          <S ID="S-4343">The labels are generated during rule extraction.</S>
          <S ID="S-4344">When we create a rule from a training example, we replace a subtree or dependency structure with a non-terminal and associate it with the POS tag of the head word if the non-terminal corresponds to a single-rooted tree on the target side.</S>
          <S ID="S-4345">Otherwise, it is assigned the generic label X.</S>
