        <S ID="S-8551">In recent years, syntax-based translation models (<REF ID="R-02" RPTR="6">Chiang, 2007</REF>; <REF ID="R-04" RPTR="12">Galley et al., 2004</REF>; <REF ID="R-12" RPTR="21">Liu et al., 2006</REF>) have shown promising progress in improving translation quality, thanks to the incorporation of phrasal translation adopted from the widely used phrase-based models (<REF ID="R-19" RPTR="31">Och and Ney, 2004</REF>) to handle local fluency and the engagement of synchronous context-free grammars (SCFG) to handle non-local phrase reordering.</S>
        <S ID="S-8552">Approaches to syntaxbased translation models can be largely categorized</S>

      <P>
        <S ID="S-8553">into two classes based on their dependency on annotated corpus (<REF ID="R-02" RPTR="7">Chiang, 2007</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-8554">Linguistically syntaxbased models (e.g., (<REF ID="R-27" RPTR="40">Yamada and Knight, 2001</REF>; <REF ID="R-04" RPTR="13">Galley et al., 2004</REF>; <REF ID="R-12" RPTR="22">Liu et al., 2006</REF>)) utilize structures defined over linguistic theory and annotations (e.g., Penn Treebank) and guide the derivation of SCFG rules with explicit parsing on at least one side of the parallel corpus.</S>
        <S ID="S-8555">Formally syntax-based models (e.g., (<REF ID="R-24" RPTR="37">Wu, 1997</REF>; <REF ID="R-02" RPTR="8">Chiang, 2007</REF>)) extract synchronous grammars from parallel corpora based on the hierarchical structure of natural language pairs without any explicit linguistic knowledge or annotations.</S>
        <S ID="S-8556">In this work, we focus on the hierarchical phrase-based models of <REF ID="R-02" RPTR="2">Chiang (2007)</REF>, which is formally syntax-based, and always refer the term SCFG, from now on, to the grammars of this model class.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-8557">On the one hand, hierarchical phrase-based models do not suffer from errors in syntactic constraints that are unavoidable in linguistically syntax-based models.</S>
        <S ID="S-8558">Despite the complete lack of linguistic guidance, the performance of hierarchical phrasebased models is competitive when compared to linguistically syntax-based models.</S>
        <S ID="S-8559">As shown in (<REF ID="R-16" RPTR="26">Mi and Huang, 2008</REF>), hierarchical phrase-based models significantly outperform tree-to-string models (<REF ID="R-12" RPTR="23">Liu et al., 2006</REF>; <REF ID="R-08" RPTR="17">Huang et al., 2006</REF>), even when attempts are made to alleviate parsing errors using either forest-based decoding (<REF ID="R-17" RPTR="29">Mi et al., 2008</REF>) or forest-based rule extraction (<REF ID="R-16" RPTR="27">Mi and Huang, 2008</REF>).</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-8560">On the other hand, when properly used, syntactic constraints can provide invaluable benefits to improve translation quality.</S>

        <S ID="S-8563"><REF ID="R-03" RPTR="10">Chiang (2010)</REF> also obtained significant improvement over his hierarchical baseline by using syntactic parse trees on both source and target sides to induce fuzzy (not exact) tree-to-tree rules and by also allowing syntactically mismatched substitutions.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-8564">In this paper, we augment rules in hierarchical phrase-based translation systems with novel syntactic features.</S>
        <S ID="S-8565">Unlike previous studies (e.g., (Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006)) that directly use explicit treebank categories such as NP, NP/PP (NP missing PP from the right) to annotate phrase pairs, we induce a set of latent categories to capture the syntactic dependencies inherent in the hierarchical structure of phrase pairs, and derive a real-valued feature vector for each X nonterminal of a SCFG rule based on the distribution of the latent categories.</S>
        <S ID="S-8566">Moreover, we convert the equality test of two sequences of syntactic categories, which are either identical or different, into the computation of a similarity score between their corresponding feature vectors.</S>
        <S ID="S-8567">In our model, two symbolically different sequences of syntactic categories could have a high similarity score in the feature vector representation if they are syntactically similar, and a low score otherwise.</S>
        <S ID="S-8568">In decoding, these feature vectors are utilized to measure the similarity between the syntactic analysis of the source side and the syntax of the SCFG rules that are applied to derive translations.</S>
        <S ID="S-8569">Our approach maintains the advantages of hierarchical phrase-based translation systems while at the same time naturally incorporates soft syntactic constraints.</S>
        <S ID="S-8570">To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that applies real-valued syntactic feature vectors to machine translation.</S>

        <S ID="S-8576">An SCFG is a synchronous rewriting system generating source and target side string pairs simultaneously based on a context-free grammar.</S>

        <S ID="S-8585">An aligned sentence pair is a tuple (E, F, A), where E = e 1 &#183; &#183; &#183; e n can be interpreted as an English sentence of length n, F = f 1 &#183; &#183; &#183; f m its translation of length m in a foreign language, and A a set of links between words of the two sentences.</S>

        <S ID="S-8587">Widely adopted in phrase-based models (<REF ID="R-19" RPTR="32">Och and Ney, 2004</REF>), a pair of consecutive sequences of words from E and F is a phrase pair if all words are aligned only within the sequences and not to any word outside.</S>

        <S ID="S-8598">In the second step, abstract rules are extracted from tight phrase pairs that contain other tight phrase pairs by replacing the sub phrase pairs with co-indexed X- nonterminals.</S>
        <S ID="S-8599"><REF ID="R-02" RPTR="3">Chiang (2007)</REF> also introduced several requirements (e.g., there are at most two nonterminals at the right hand side of a rule) to safeguard the quality of the abstract rules as well as keeping decoding efficient.</S>

        <S ID="S-8602">The use of a unified X nonterminal makes hierarchical phrase-based models flexible at capturing non-local reordering of phrases.</S>
        <S ID="S-8603">However, such flexibility also comes at the cost that it is not able to differentiate between different syntactic usages of phrases.</S>
        <S ID="S-8604">Suppose rule X &#8594; &#12296;I am reading X 1 , &#183; &#183; &#183; &#12297; is extracted from a phrase pair with I am reading a book on the source side where X 1 is abstracted from the noun phrase pair .</S>
        <S ID="S-8605">If this rule is used to translate I am reading the brochure of a book fair, it would be better to apply it over the entire string than over sub-strings such as I ... the brochure of.</S>
        <S ID="S-8606">This is because the nonterminal X 1 in the rule was abstracted from a noun phrase on the source side of the training data and would thus be better (more informative) to be applied to phrases of the same type.</S>
        <S ID="S-8607">Hierarchical phrase-based models are not able to distinguish syntactic differences like this.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-8608">Zollmann and Venugopal (2006) attempted to address this problem by annotating phrase pairs with treebank categories based on automatic parse trees.</S>
        <S ID="S-8609">They introduced an extended set of categories (e.g., NP+V for she went and DT\NP for great wall, an noun phrase with a missing determiner on the left) to annotate phrase pairs that do not align with syntactic constituents.</S>
        <S ID="S-8610">Their hard syntactic constraint requires that the nonterminals should match exactly to rewrite with a rule, which could rule out potentially correct derivations due to errors in the syntactic parses as well as to data sparsity.</S>
        <S ID="S-8611">For example, NP cannot be instantiated with phrase pairs of type DT+NN, in spite of their syntactic similarity.</S>
        <S ID="S-8612"><REF ID="R-22" RPTR="35">Venugopal et al. (2009)</REF> addressed this problem by directly introducing soft syntactic preferences into SCFG rules using preference grammars, but they had to face the computational challenges of large preference vectors.</S>
        <S ID="S-8613"><REF ID="R-03" RPTR="11">Chiang (2010)</REF> also avoided hard constraints and took a soft alternative that directly models the cost of mismatched rule substitutions.</S>
        <S ID="S-8614">This, however, would require a large number of parameters to be tuned on a generally small-sized heldout set, and it could thus suffer from over-tuning.</S>

      <HEADER>3 Approach Overview</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-8615">In this work, we take a different approach to introduce linguistic syntax to hierarchical phrase-based translation systems and impose soft syntactic constraints between derivation rules and the syntactic parse of the sentence to be translated.</S>
        <S ID="S-8616">For each phrase pair extracted from a sentence pair of a source-side parsed parallel corpus, we abstract its syntax by the sequence of highest root categories, which we call a tag sequence, that exactly 1 dominates the syntactic tree fragments of the source-side phrase.</S>
        <S ID="S-8617">Figure 3 (b) shows the source-side parse tree of a sentence pair.</S>
        <S ID="S-8618">The tag sequence for &#8220;the pen&#8221; is simply &#8220;NP&#8221; because it is a noun phrase, while phrase &#8220;give the pen&#8221; is dominated by a verb followed by a noun phrase, and thus its tag sequence is &#8220;VBP NP&#8221;.</S>

        <S ID="S-8631">For example, P &#8407; &#8220;NP VP&#8221; (C) = {0.5, 0.2, 0.3} means that the latent syntactic categories c 1 , c 2 , and c 3 are distributed as p(c 1 ) = 0.5, p(c 2 ) = 0.2, and p(c 3 ) = 0.3 for tag sequence &#8220;NP VP&#8221;.</S>
        <S ID="S-8632">We further convert the distribution to a normalized feature vector F &#8407; (ts) to represent tag sequence ts:</S>

      <P>
        <S ID="S-8795">Our approach identifies &#8764;180k unique tag sequences for the English side of phrase pairs in both tasks.</S>
        <S ID="S-8796">As shown by the examples in Table 2, the syntactic feature vector representation is able to identify similar and dissimilar tag sequences.</S>
        <S ID="S-8797">For instance, it determines that the sequence of &#8220;DT JJ NN&#8221; is syntactically very similar to &#8220;DT ADJP NN&#8221; while very dissimilar to &#8220;NN CD VP&#8221;.</S>
        <S ID="S-8798">Notice that our latent categories are learned automatically to maximize the likelihood of the training forests extracted based on alignment and are not explicitly instructed to discriminate between syntactically different tag sequences.</S>
        <S ID="S-8799">Our approach is not guaranteed to always assign similar feature vectors to syntactically similar tag sequences.</S>
        <S ID="S-8800">However, as the experimental results show below, the latent categories are able to capture some similarities among tag sequences that are beneficial for translation.</S>

        <S ID="S-8801">Table 3 and 4 report the experimental results on the English-to-German and English-to-Chinese tasks, respectively.</S>
        <S ID="S-8802">The addition of the syntax feature achieves a statistically significant improvement (p &#8804; 0.01) of 0.6 in BLEU on the test set of the Baseline +Syntax &#8710;</S>

        <S ID="S-8804">English-to-German task.</S>
        <S ID="S-8805">This improvement is substantial given that only one reference is used for each test sentence.</S>
        <S ID="S-8806">On the English-to-Chinese task, the syntax feature achieves a smaller improvement of 0.41 BLEU on the test set.</S>
        <S ID="S-8807">One potential explanation for the smaller improvement is that the sentences on the English-to-Chinese task are much shorter, with an average of only 6 words per sentence, compared to 15 words in the English-to-German task.</S>
        <S ID="S-8808">The hypothesis space of translating a longer sentence is much larger than that of a shorter sentence.</S>
        <S ID="S-8809">Therefore, there is more potential gain from using syntax features to rule out unlikely derivations of longer sentences, while phrasal rules might be adequate for shorter sentences, leaving less room for syntax to help as in the case of the English-to-Chinese task.</S>

      <P>
        <S ID="S-8810">The incorporation of the syntactic feature into the hierarchical phrase-based translation system also brings in additional memory load and computational cost.</S>
        <S ID="S-8811">In the worst case, our approach requires storing one feature vector for each tag sequence and one feature vector for each nonterminal of a SCFG rule, with the latter taking the majority of the extra memory storage.</S>
        <S ID="S-8812">We observed that about 90% of the X nonterminals in the rules only have one tag sequence, and thus the required memory space can be significantly reduced by only storing a pointer to the feature vector of the tag sequence for these nonterminals.</S>
        <S ID="S-8813">Our approach also requires computing one dot-product of two feature vectors for each nonterminal when a SCFG rule is applied to a source span.</S>
      </P>

        <S ID="S-8814">DT JJ NN</S>

      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-8817">This cost can be reduced, however, by caching the dot-products of the tag sequences that are frequently accessed.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-8818">There are other successful investigations to impose soft syntactic constraints to hierarchical phrase-based models by either introducing syntaxbased rule features such as the prior derivation model of <REF ID="R-29" RPTR="43">Zhou et al. (2008)</REF> or by imposing constraints on translation spans at decoding time, e.g., (<REF ID="R-14" RPTR="24">Marton and Resnik, 2008</REF>; <REF ID="R-25" RPTR="38">Xiong et al., 2009</REF>; <REF ID="R-26" RPTR="39">Xiong et al., 2010</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-8819">These approaches are all orthogonal to ours and it is expected that they can be combined with our approach to achieve greater improvement.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-8820">This work is an initial effort to investigate latent syntactic categories to enhance hierarchical phrasebased translation models, and there are many directions to continue this line of research.</S>
        <S ID="S-8821">First, while the current approach imposes soft syntactic constraints between the parse structure of the source sentence and the SCFG rules used to derive the translation, the real-valued syntactic feature vectors can also be used to impose soft constraints between SCFG rules when rule rewrite occurs.</S>
        <S ID="S-8822">In this case, target side parse trees could also be used alone or together with the source side parse trees to induce the latent syntactic categories.</S>
        <S ID="S-8823">Second, instead of using single parse trees during both training and decoding, our approach is likely to benefit from exploring parse forests as in (<REF ID="R-16" RPTR="28">Mi and Huang, 2008</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-8824">Third, in addition to the treebank categories obtained by syntactic parsing, lexical cues directly available in sentence pairs could also to explored to guide the learning of latent categories.</S>
        <S ID="S-8825">Last but not the least, it would be interesting to investigate discriminative training approaches to learn latent categories that directly optimize on translation quality.</S>

      <HEADER>8 Conclusion</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-8826">We have presented a novel approach to enhance hierarchical phrase-based machine translation systems with real-valued linguistically motivated feature vectors.</S>
        <S ID="S-8827">Our approach maintains the advantages of hierarchical phrase-based translation systems while at the same time naturally incorporates soft syntactic constraints.</S>
        <S ID="S-8828">Experimental results showed that this approach improves the baseline hierarchical phrase-based translation models on both English-to-German and English-to-Chinese tasks.</S>
        <S ID="S-8829">We will continue this line of research and exploit better ways to learn syntax and apply syntactic constraints to machine translation.</S>
