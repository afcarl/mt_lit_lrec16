  <ABSTRACT>
    <A-S ID="S-45119">Ontologies and taxonomies are widely used to organize concepts providing the basis for activities such as indexing, and as background knowledge for NLP tasks.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-45120">As such, translation of these resources would prove useful to adapt these systems to new languages.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-45121">However, we show that the nature of these resources is significantly different from the &#8220;free-text&#8221; paradigm used to train most statistical machine translation systems.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-45122">In particular, we see significant differences in the linguistic nature of these resources and such resources have rich additional semantics.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-45123">We demonstrate that as a result of these linguistic differences, standard SMT methods, in particular evaluation metrics, can produce poor performance.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-45124">We then look to the task of leveraging these semantics for translation, which we approach in three ways: by adapting the translation system to the domain of the resource; by examining if semantics can help to predict the syntactic structure used in translation; and by evaluating if we can use existing translated taxonomies to disambiguate translations.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-45125">We present some early results from these experiments, which shed light on the degree of success we may have with each approach.</A-S>

        <S ID="S-45132">Taxonomies and ontologies are data structures that organise conceptual information by establishing relations among concepts, hierarchical and partitive relations being the most important ones.</S>
        <S ID="S-45133">Nowadays, ontologies have a wide range of uses in many domains, for example, finance (International Accounting Standards Board, 2007), bio-medicine (<REF ID="R-09" RPTR="10">Collier et al., 2008</REF>) (<REF ID="R-01" RPTR="1">Ashburner et al., 2000</REF>) and libraries (<REF ID="R-22" RPTR="24">Mischo, 1982</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-45134">These resources normally attach labels in natural language to the concepts and relations that define their structure, and these labels can be used for a number of purposes, such as providing user interface localization (<REF ID="R-21" RPTR="23">McCrae et al., 2010</REF>), multilingual data access (Declerck et al., 2010), information extraction (M&#252;ller et al., 2004) and natural language generation (<REF ID="R-04" RPTR="5">Bontcheva, 2005</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-45135">It seems natural that for applications that use such ontologies and taxonomies, translation of the natural language descriptions associated with them is required in order to adapt these methods to new languages.</S>
        <S ID="S-45136">Currently, there has been some work on this in the context of ontology localisation, such as <REF ID="R-11" RPTR="12">Espinoza et al. (2008)</REF> and (2009), <REF ID="R-08" RPTR="9">Cimiano et al. (2010)</REF><REF ID="R-14" RPTR="14">(2010)</REF>, Fu et al. <REF ID="R-14" RPTR="15">(2010)</REF> and Navigli and Penzetto <REF ID="R-14" RPTR="16">(2010)</REF>.</S>
        <S ID="S-45137">However, this work has focused on the case in which exact or partial translations are found in other similar resources such as bilingual lexica.</S>
        <S ID="S-45138">Instead, in this paper we look at how we may gain an adequate translation using statistical machine translation approaches that also utilise the semantic information beyond the label or term describing the concept, that is relations among the concepts in the ontology, as well as the attributes or properties that describe concepts, as will be explained in more detail in section 2.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-45139">Current work in machine translation has shown that word sense disambiguation can play an important role by using the surrounding words as context to disambiguate terms (<REF ID="R-06" RPTR="8">Carpuat and Wu, 2007</REF>) (<REF ID="R-00" RPTR="0">Apidianaki, 2009</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-45140">Such techniques have</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-45141">been extrapolated to the translation of taxonomies and ontologies, in which the &#8220;context&#8221; of a taxonomy or ontology label corresponds to the ontology structure that surrounds the label in question.</S>
        <S ID="S-45142">This structure, which is made up of the lexical information provided by labels and the semantic information provided by the ontology structure, defines the sense of the concept and can be exploited in the disambiguation process (<REF ID="R-11" RPTR="13">Espinoza et al., 2008</REF>).</S>

        <HEADER>2.1 Formal Definition</HEADER>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-45143">We define a taxonomy as a set of concepts, C, with equivalence (synonymy) links, S, subsumption (hypernymy) links, H, and a labelling function l that maps each concept to a single label from a language &#931; &#8727; .</S>
          <S ID="S-45144">Formally we define a taxonomy, T , as a set of tuples (C, S, H, l) such that S &#8838; P(C &#215; C) and H &#8838; P(C &#215; C) and l is a function in C &#8594; &#931; &#8727; .</S>
          <S ID="S-45145">We also require that S is a transitive, symmetric and reflexive relation, and H is transitive.</S>
          <S ID="S-45146">While we note here that this abstraction does not come close to capturing the full expressive power of many ontologies (or even taxonomies), it is sufficient for this paper to focus on the use of only equivalence and subsumption relationships for translation.</S>

        <P>
          <S ID="S-45147">Another important issue to note here is that the kind of language used within ontologies and taxonomies is significantly different from that found within free text.</S>
          <S ID="S-45148">In particular, we observe that the terms used to designate concepts are frequently just noun phrases and are significantly shorter than a usual sentence.</S>
          <S ID="S-45149">In the case of the relations between concepts (dubbed object properties) and attributes of concepts (data type properties), these are occasionally labelled by means of verbal phrases.</S>
          <S ID="S-45150">We demonstrate this by looking at three widely used ontologies/taxonomies.</S>

          <S ID="S-45157">We note that while some of the terms are technical and do not require translation, e.g., ESCRT-I, the majority do, e.g., cytokinesis by cell plate formation.</S>

        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-45161">We applied tokenization and manual phrase analysis to the labels in these resources and the results are summarized in table 1.</S>
          <S ID="S-45162">As can be observed, the variety of types of labels we may come across when linguistically analysing and translating ontology and taxonomy labels is quite large.</S>
          <S ID="S-45163">We can identify the two following properties that may influence the translation process of taxonomy and ontology labels.</S>
          <S ID="S-45164">Firstly, the length of terms ranges from single words to highly complex compound phrases, but is still generally shorter than a sentence.</S>
          <S ID="S-45165">Secondly, terms are frequently about highly specialized domains of knowledge.</S>
          <S ID="S-45166">For properties in the ontology we also identify terms which consist of:</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-45167">&#8226; Noun phrases identifying concepts.</S>

        <P>
          <S ID="S-45172">For the purpose of training systems to work on the translation of ontologies and taxonomies, it is necessary to create a corpus that has similar linguistic structure to that found in ontologies and taxonomies.</S>
          <S ID="S-45173">We used the titles of Wikipedia 1 for the following</S>

        <P>
          <S ID="S-45177">&#8226; The titles of articles have similar properties to the ontologies labels mentioned above with an average of 2.46 tokens.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-45178">&#8226; There are a very large number of labels.</S>
          <S ID="S-45179">In fact we found that there were 5,941,890 2 articles of which 3,515,640 were content pages (i.e., not special pages such as category pages)</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-45180">We included non-content pages (in particular, category pages) in the corpus as they were generally useful for translation, especially the titles of category pages.</S>
          <S ID="S-45181">In table 2 we see the number of translations, which we further grouped according to whether they actually corresponded to pages in the other languages, as it is also possible that the translations links pointed to subsections of an article or to missing pages.</S>
          <S ID="S-45182">Wikipedia also includes redirect links that allow for alternative titles to be mapped to a given concept.</S>
          <S ID="S-45183">These can be useful as they contain synonyms, but also introduce a lot more noise into the corpus as they also include misspelled and foreign terms.</S>
          <S ID="S-45184">To evaluate the effectiveness of including these data for creating a machine translation corpus, we took a random sample of 100 pages which at least one page redirects to (there are 1,244,647 of these pages in total).</S>
          <S ID="S-45185">We found that these pages had a total of 242 extra titles from the redirect page of which</S>

          <S ID="S-45187">204 (84.3%) where true synonyms, 19 (7.9%) were misspellings, 8 (3.3%) were foreign names for concepts (e.g., the French name for &#8220;Zeebrugge&#8221;), and 11 (4.5%) were unrelated.</S>
          <S ID="S-45188">As such, we conclude that these extra titles were useful for constructing the corpus, increasing the size of the corpus by approximately 50% across all languages.</S>
          <S ID="S-45189">There are several advantages to deriving a corpus from Wikipedia, for example it is possible to provide some hierarchical links by the use of the category that a page belongs to, such as has been performed by the DBpedia project (<REF ID="R-02" RPTR="3">Auer et al., 2007</REF>).</S>

        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-45191">Given the linguistic differences in taxonomy and ontology labels, it seems necessary to investigate the effectiveness of various metrics for the evaluation of translation quality.</S>
          <S ID="S-45192">There are a number of metrics that are widely used for evaluating translation.</S>
          <S ID="S-45193">Here we will focus on some of the most widely used, namely BLEU (<REF ID="R-25" RPTR="25">Papineni et al., 2002</REF>), NIST (<REF ID="R-10" RPTR="11">Doddington, 2002</REF>), METEOR (<REF ID="R-03" RPTR="4">Banerjee and Lavie, 2005</REF>) and WER (<REF ID="R-20" RPTR="22">McCowan et al., 2004</REF>).</S>
          <S ID="S-45194">However, it is not clear which of these methods correlate best with human evaluation, particularly for the ontologies with short labels.</S>
          <S ID="S-45195">To evaluate this we collected a mixture of ontologies with short labels on the topics of human diseases, agriculture, geometry and project management, producing 437 labels.</S>
          <S ID="S-45196">These were translated with web translation services from English to Spanish, in particular Google Translate 3 , Yahoo!</S>
          <S ID="S-45197">BabelFish 4 and SDL FreeTranslation 5 .</S>
          <S ID="S-45198">Having obtained translations for each label in the ontology we calculated the evaluation scores using the four metrics mentioned above.</S>
          <S ID="S-45199">We found that the source ontologies had an average</S>

          <S ID="S-45201">label length of 2.45 tokens and the translations generated had an average length of 2.16 tokens.</S>
          <S ID="S-45202">We then created a data set by mixing the translations from the web translation services with a number of translations from the source ontologies, to act as a control.</S>
          <S ID="S-45203">We then gave these translations to 3 evaluators, who scored them for adequacy and fluency as described in <REF ID="R-19" RPTR="21">Koehn (2010)</REF><REF ID="R-14" RPTR="17">(2010)</REF>.</S>
          <S ID="S-45204">Finally, we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient between the automatic scores and the manual scores obtained.</S>
          <S ID="S-45205">These are presented in table 3 and figure 1.</S>
          <S ID="S-45206">As we can see from these results, one metric, namely METEOR, seems to perform best in evaluating the quality of the translations.</S>
          <S ID="S-45207">In fact this is not surprising as there is a clear mathematical deficiency that both NIST and BLEU have for evaluating translations for very short labels like the ones we have here.</S>
          <S ID="S-45208">To illustrate this, we recall the formulation of BLEU as given in (<REF ID="R-25" RPTR="26">Papineni et al., 2002</REF>):</S>

          <S ID="S-45213">We note, however, that for very short labels it is highly likely that p n will be zero.</S>
          <S ID="S-45214">This creates a significant issue, as from the equation above, if any of the values of p n are zero, the overall score, BLEU, will also be zero.</S>

          <S ID="S-45218">As such, for the taxonomy and ontology translation task we do not recommend using BLEU or NIST as an evaluation metric.</S>
          <S ID="S-45219">We note that METEOR is a more sophisticated method than WER and, as expected, performs better.</S>

        <P>
          <S ID="S-45233">One key question to figure out is: if we have a semantic model can this be used to predict the syntactic structure of the translation to a significant degree?</S>
          <S ID="S-45234">As an example of this we consider the taxonomic term &#8220;statement&#8221;, which is translated by Google Translate 7 to German as &#8220;Erkl&#228;rung&#8221;, whereas the term &#8220;annual statement&#8221; is translated as &#8220;Jahresabschluss&#8221;.</S>
          <S ID="S-45235">However, if the taxonomy contains a subsumption (hypernymy) relationship between these terms we can deduce that the translation &#8220;Erkl&#228;rung&#8221; is not correct and the translation &#8220;Abschluss&#8221; should be preferred.</S>
          <S ID="S-45236">We chose to evaluate this idea on the IFRS taxonomy as the labels it contains are much longer and more structured than some of the other resources.</S>
          <S ID="S-45237">Furthermore, in this taxonomy the original English labels have been translated into ten languages, so that it is already a multilingual resource</S>

          <S ID="S-45239">that can be used as gold standard.</S>
          <S ID="S-45240">Regarding the syntax of labels, it is often the case that one term is derived from another by addition of a complementary phrase.</S>
          <S ID="S-45241">For example the following terms all exist in the taxonomy:</S>

          <S ID="S-45250">A high-quality translation of these terms would ideally preserve this same syntactic structure in the target language.We attempt to answer how useful ontological structure is by trying to deduce if there is a semantic relationship between terms then is it more likely that there is a syntactic relationship.</S>
          <S ID="S-45251">We started by simplifying the idea of syntactic dependency to the following: we say that two terms are syntactically related if one label is a sub-string of another, so that in the example above the first label is syntactically related to the other three and the second is related to the last two.</S>
          <S ID="S-45252">For English, we found that there were 3744 syntactically related terms according to this criteria, corresponding to 0.1% of all label pairs within the taxonomy, for all languages.</S>
          <S ID="S-45253">For ontology structure we used the number of relations indicated in the taxonomy, of which there are 1070 indicating a subsumption relationship and 987 indicating a partitive relationship 8 .</S>

          <S ID="S-45257">0.08% of label pairs were semantically related.</S>
          <S ID="S-45258">We then examined if the semantic relation could predict whether there was a syntactic relationship between the terms in a single language.</S>
          <S ID="S-45259">We define N s as the number of label pairs with a subsumption relationship and similarly define N p , N n and N syn for partitive, semantically unrelated and syntactically related pairs.</S>

          <S ID="S-45261">As such we define the following values</S>

        <P>
          <S ID="S-45264">As we can see from these results, it seems that both subsumption and partitive relationships are strongly indicative of syntactic relationships as we might expect.</S>
          <S ID="S-45265">The second question is: is it more likely that we see a syntactic dependency in translation if we have a semantic relationship, i.e., is the syntax more likely to be preserved if these terms are semantically related.</S>
          <S ID="S-45266">We define N syne as the value of N syn for a language e, e.g., N synen is the number of syntactically related English label pairs in the taxonomy.</S>
          <S ID="S-45267">As each label has exactly one translation we can also define N syne &#8743;syn f &#8743;s as the number of concepts whose labels are syntactically related in both language e and f and are semantically related by a subsumption relationship; similarly we define N syne &#8743;syn f &#8743;p and N syne &#8743;syn f &#8743;n.</S>

        <P>
          <S ID="S-45273">The partitive data was very sparse, due to the fact that only 15 concepts in the source taxonomy had a partitive relationship and were syntactically related, so we cannot draw any strong conclusions from it.</S>
          <S ID="S-45274">For the subsumption relationship we have a clearer result and in fact averaged across all language pairs we found that the likelihood of the syntax being preserved in the translation was nearly exactly the same for semantically related and semantically unrelated concepts.</S>
          <S ID="S-45275">From this result we can conclude that the probability of syntax given either subsumptive or partitive relationship is not very large, at least from the reduced syntactic model we used here.</S>
          <S ID="S-45276">While our model reduces syntax to n-gram overlap, we believe that if there was a stronger correlation using a more sophisticated syntactic model, we would still see some noticable effect here as we did monolingually.</S>

        <HEADER>5.3 Comparison of ontology structure</HEADER>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-45279">Our third intuition in approaching ontology translation is that the comparison of ontology or taxonomy structures containing source and target labels may help in the disambiguation process of translation candidates.</S>
          <S ID="S-45280">A prerequisite in this sense is the availability of equivalent (or similar) ontology structures to be compared.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-45281">From a technical point of view, we consider the translation task as a word sense disambiguation task.</S>
          <S ID="S-45282">We identify two methods for comparing ontology structures, which are illustrated in Figure 2.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-45283">The first method relies on a multilingual resource, i.e., a multilingual ontology or taxonomy.</S>
          <S ID="S-45284">The ontology represented on the left-hand side of the figure consists of several monolingual conceptualizations related to each other by means of an interlingual index, as is the case in the EuroWordNet lexicon (<REF ID="R-30" RPTR="30">Vossen, 1999</REF>).</S>
          <S ID="S-45285">For example, if the original label is chair for seat in English, several translations for it are obtained in Spanish such as: silla (for seat), c&#225;tedra (for university position), presidente (for person leading a meeting).</S>
          <S ID="S-45286">Each of these correspond to a sense in the English WordNet, and hence each translation selects a hierachical structure with English labels.</S>
          <S ID="S-45287">The next step is to compare the input structure of the original ontology containing chair against the three different structures in English representing the several senses of chair and obtain the corresponding label in Spanish.</S>
          <S ID="S-45288">The second method relies on a monolingual resource, i.e., on monolingual ontologies in the target language, which means that we need to compare structures documented with labels in different languages.</S>
          <S ID="S-45289">As such we obtain a separate translated ontologies for each combination of label translations suggested by the baseline system.</S>
          <S ID="S-45290">Selecting the correct translations is then clearly a hard optimization problem.</S>
          <S ID="S-45291">For the time being, we have only experimented with the first approach using EuroWordNet.</S>
          <S ID="S-45292">Several solutions have been proposed in the context of ontology matching in a monolingual scenario (see (<REF ID="R-27" RPTR="28">Shvaiko and Euzenat, 2005</REF>) or (<REF ID="R-15" RPTR="18">Giunchiglia et al., 2006</REF>)).</S>
          <S ID="S-45293">The ranking method we use to compare structures relies on an equivalence probability measure between two candidate structures, as proposed in (<REF ID="R-29" RPTR="29">Trillo et al., 2007</REF>).</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-45294">We assume that we have a taxonomy or ontology entity o 1 and we wish to deduce if it is similar to another taxonomy or ontology entity o 2 from a reference taxonomy or ontology (i.e., EuroWordNet) in the same language.</S>
          <S ID="S-45295">We shall make a simplifying assumption that each ontology entity is associated with a unique label, e.g., l o1 .</S>
          <S ID="S-45296">As such we wish to deduce if o 1 represents the same concept as o 2 and hence if l o2 is a translation for l o1 .</S>
          <S ID="S-45297">Our model relies on the Vector Space Model (<REF ID="R-26" RPTR="27">Raghavan and Wong, 1986</REF>) to calculate the similarity between different labels, which essentially involves calculating a vector from the bag of words contained within each labels and then calculating the cosine similarity between these vectors.</S>

      <HEADER>6 Conclusion</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-45329">In this paper we presented the problem of ontology and taxonomy translation as a special case of machine translation that has certain extra characteristics.</S>
        <S ID="S-45330">Our examination of the problem showed that the main two differences are the presence of structured semantics and shorter, hence more ambiguous, labels.</S>
        <S ID="S-45331">We demonstrated that as a result of this linguistic nature, some machine translation metrics do not perform as well as they do in free-text translations.</S>
        <S ID="S-45332">We then presented the results of early investigations into how we may use the special features of taxonomy and ontology translation to improve quality of translation.</S>
        <S ID="S-45333">The first of these was domain adaptation, which in line with other authors is useful for texts in a particular domain.</S>
        <S ID="S-45334">We also investigated the possibility of using the link between syntactic similarity and semantic similarity to help, however although we find that mono-lingually there was a strong correspondence between syntax and semantics, this result did not seem to extend well to a cross-lingual setting.</S>
        <S ID="S-45335">As such we believe there may only be slight benefits of using techniques, however further investigation is needed.</S>
        <S ID="S-45336">Finally, we looked at using word sense disambiguation by comparing the structure of the input ontology to that of an already translated reference ontology.</S>
        <S ID="S-45337">We found this method to be very effective in choosing the best translations.</S>
        <S ID="S-45338">However it is dependent on the existence of a multilingual resource that already has such terms.</S>
        <S ID="S-45339">As such, we view the topic of taxonomy and ontology translation as an interesting sub-problem of machine translation and believe there is still much fruitful work to be done to obtain a system that can correctly leverage the semantics present in these data structures in a way that improves translation quality.</S>
