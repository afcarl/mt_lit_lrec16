  <ABSTRACT>
    <A-S ID="S-27942">In this paper we present a confidence measure for word alignment based on the posterior probability of alignment links.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-27943">We introduce sentence alignment confidence measure and alignment link confidence measure.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-27944">Based on these measures, we improve the alignment quality by selecting high confidence sentence alignments and alignment links from multiple word alignments of the same sentence pair.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-27945">Additionally, we remove low confidence alignment links from the word alignment of a bilingual training corpus, which increases the alignment F-score, improves Chinese-English and Arabic-English translation quality and significantly reduces the phrase translation table size.</A-S>

      <HEADER>1 Introduction</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-27946">Data-driven approaches have been quite active in recent machine translation (MT) research.</S>
        <S ID="S-27947">Many MT systems, such as statistical phrase-based and syntax-based systems, learn phrase translation pairs or translation rules from large amount of bilingual data with word alignment.</S>
        <S ID="S-27948">The quality of the parallel data and the word alignment have significant impacts on the learned translation models and ultimately the quality of translation output.</S>
        <S ID="S-27949">Due to the high cost of commissioned translation, many parallel sentences are automatically extracted from comparable corpora, which inevitably introduce many &#8221;noises&#8221;, i.e., inaccurate or non-literal translations.</S>
        <S ID="S-27950">Given the huge amount of bilingual training data, word alignments are automatically generated using various algorithms ((<REF ID="R-06" RPTR="8">Brown et al., 1994</REF>), (<REF ID="R-16" RPTR="22">Vogel et al., 1996</REF>) Figure 1: An example of inaccurate translation and word alignment.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-27951">and (<REF ID="R-10" RPTR="14">Ittycheriah and Roukos, 2005</REF>)), which also introduce many word alignment errors.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-27952">The example in Figure 1 shows the word alignment of the given Chinese and English sentence pair, where the English words following each Chinese word is its literal translation.</S>
        <S ID="S-27953">We find untranslated Chinese and English words (marked with underlines).</S>
        <S ID="S-27954">These spurious words cause significant word alignment errors (as shown with dash lines), which in turn directly affect the quality of phrase translation tables or translation rules that are learned based on word alignment.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-27955">In this paper we introduce a confidence measure for word alignment, which is robust to extra or missing words in the bilingual sentence pairs, as well as word alignment errors.</S>
        <S ID="S-27956">We propose a sentence alignment confidence measure based on the alignment&#8217;s posterior probability, and extend it to the alignment link confidence measure.</S>
        <S ID="S-27957">We illustrate the correlation between the alignment confidence measure and the alignment quality on the sentence level, and present several approaches to improve alignment accuracy based on the proposed confidence measure: sentence alignment selection, alignment link combination and alignment link filtering.</S>
        <S ID="S-27958">Finally we demonstrate</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-27959">the improved alignments also lead to better MT quality.</S>
        <S ID="S-27960">The paper is organized as follows: In section 2 we introduce the sentence and alignment link confidence measures.</S>
        <S ID="S-27961">In section 3 we demonstrate two approaches to improve alignment accuracy through alignment combination.</S>
        <S ID="S-27962">In section 4 we show how to improve a MaxEnt word alignment quality by removing low confidence alignment links, which also leads to improved translation quality as shown in section 5.</S>

      <P>
        <S ID="S-28165">In this paper we presented two alignment confidence measures for word alignment.</S>

      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-28167">lected among multiple alignments and it obtained 0.8 F-measure improvement over the single best Chinese-English aligner.</S>
        <S ID="S-28168">The second is the alignment link confidence measure, which selects the most reliable links from multiple alignments and obtained 1.5 F-measure improvement.</S>
        <S ID="S-28169">When we removed low confidence links from the MaxEnt aligner, we reduced the Chinese-English alignment error by 5% and the Arabic-English alignment error by 10%.</S>
        <S ID="S-28170">The cleaned alignment significantly reduced the size of phrase translation tables by 15-35%.</S>
        <S ID="S-28171">It furthermore led to better translation scores for Chinese and Arabic documents with different genres.</S>
        <S ID="S-28172">In particular, it improved the translation scores of the tail documents by 0.5-1.4 points measured by the combined metric of (TER- BLEU)/2.</S>
        <S ID="S-28173">For future work we would like to explore richer models to estimate alignment posterior probability.</S>
        <S ID="S-28174">In most cases, exact calculation by summing over all possible alignments is impossible, and approximation using N-best alignments is needed.</S>
