  <ABSTRACT>
    <A-S ID="S-19905">Translation models used for statistical machine translation are compiled from parallel corpora; such corpora are manually translated, but the direction of translation is usually unknown, and is consequently ignored.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-19906">However, much research in Translation Studies indicates that the direction of translation matters, as translated language (translationese) has many unique properties.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-19907">Specifically, phrase tables constructed from parallel corpora translated in the same direction as the translation task perform better than ones constructed from corpora translated in the opposite direction.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-19908">We reconfirm that this is indeed the case, but emphasize the importance of using also texts translated in the &#8216;wrong&#8217; direction.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-19909">We take advantage of information pertaining to the direction of translation in constructing phrase tables, by adapting the translation model to the special properties of translationese.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-19910">We define entropybased measures that estimate the correspondence of target-language phrases to translationese, thereby eliminating the need to annotate the parallel corpus with information pertaining to the direction of translation.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-19911">We show that incorporating these measures as features in the phrase tables of statistical machine translation systems results in consistent, statistically significant improvement in the quality of the translation.</A-S>

      <HEADER>1 Introduction</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-19912">Much research in Translation Studies indicates that translated texts have unique characteristics that set them apart from original texts (Toury, 1980; <REF ID="R-13" RPTR="20">Gellerstam, 1986</REF>; Toury, 1995).</S>
        <S ID="S-19913">Known as translationese, translated texts (in any language) constitute a genre, or a dialect, of the target language, which reflects both artifacts of the translation process and traces of the original language from which the texts were translated.</S>
        <S ID="S-19914">Among the better-known properties of translationese are simplification and explicitation (<REF ID="R-03" RPTR="5">Baker, 1993</REF>, 1995, 1996): translated texts tend to be shorter, to have lower type/token ratio, and to use certain discourse markers more frequently than original texts.</S>
        <S ID="S-19915">Incidentally, translated texts are so markedly different from original ones that automatic classification can identify them with very high accuracy (van Halteren, 2008; <REF ID="R-06" RPTR="6">Baroni and Bernardini, 2006</REF>; Ilisei et al., 2010; <REF ID="R-22" RPTR="39">Koppel and Ordan, 2011</REF>).</S>

      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-19917">(SMT) systems use parallel corpora to train translation models that reflect source- and targetlanguage phrase correspondences.</S>
        <S ID="S-19918">Typically, SMT systems ignore the direction of translation used to produce those corpora.</S>
        <S ID="S-19919">Given the unique properties of translationese, however, it is reasonable to assume that this direction may affect the quality of the translation.</S>
        <S ID="S-19920">Recently, Kurokawa et al. <REF ID="R-07" RPTR="7">(2009)</REF><REF ID="R-21" RPTR="30">(2009)</REF><REF ID="R-24" RPTR="40">(2009)</REF> showed that this is indeed the case.</S>
        <S ID="S-19921">They train a system to translate between French and English (and vice versa) using a Frenchtranslated-to-English parallel corpus, and then an English-translated-to-French one.</S>
        <S ID="S-19922">They find that in translating into French the latter parallel corpus yields better results, whereas for translating into English it is better to use the former.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-19923">Usually, of course, the translation direction of a parallel corpus is unknown.</S>
        <S ID="S-19924">Therefore, Kurokawa et al. <REF ID="R-07" RPTR="8">(2009)</REF><REF ID="R-21" RPTR="31">(2009)</REF><REF ID="R-24" RPTR="41">(2009)</REF> train an SVM-based classifier to predict which side of a bi-text is the origin and which one is the translation, and only use the subset of the corpus that corresponds to the translation direction of the task in training their translation model.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-19925">We use these results as our departure point, but improve them in two major ways.</S>
        <S ID="S-19926">First, we demonstrate that the other subset of the corpus, reflecting translation in the &#8216;wrong&#8217; direction, is also important for the translation task, and must not be ignored; second, we show that explicit information on the direction of translation of the parallel corpus, whether manually-annotated or machine-learned, is not mandatory.</S>
        <S ID="S-19927">This is achieved by casting the problem in the framework of domain adaptation: we use domain-adaptation techniques to direct the SMT system toward producing output that better reflects the properties of translationese.</S>
        <S ID="S-19928">We show that SMT systems adapted to translationese produce better translations than vanilla systems trained on exactly the same resources.</S>
        <S ID="S-19929">We confirm these findings using an automatic evaluation metric, BLEU (<REF ID="R-31" RPTR="61">Papineni et al., 2002</REF>), as well as through a qualitative analysis of the results.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-19930">Our departure point is the results of Kurokawa et al. <REF ID="R-07" RPTR="9">(2009)</REF><REF ID="R-21" RPTR="32">(2009)</REF><REF ID="R-24" RPTR="42">(2009)</REF>, which we successfully replicate in Section 3.</S>
        <S ID="S-19931">First (Section 4), we explain why translation quality improves when the parallel corpus is translated in the &#8216;right&#8217; direction.</S>
        <S ID="S-19932">We do so by showing that the subset of the corpus that was translated in the direction of the translation task (the &#8216;right&#8217; direction, henceforth source-to-target, or S &#8594; T ) yields phrase tables that are better suited for translation of the original language than the subset translated in the reverse direction (the &#8216;wrong&#8217; direction, henceforth target-to-source, or T &#8594; S).</S>
        <S ID="S-19933">We use several statistical measures that indicate the better quality of the phrase tables in the former case.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-19934">Then (Section 5), we explore ways to build a translation model that is adapted to the unique properties of translationese.</S>
        <S ID="S-19935">We first show that using the entire parallel corpus, including texts that are translated both in the &#8216;right&#8217; and in the &#8216;wrong&#8217; direction, improves the quality of the results.</S>
        <S ID="S-19936">Furthermore, we show that the direction of translation used for producing the parallel corpus can be approximated by defining several entropybased measures that correlate well with translationese, and, consequently, with the quality of the translation.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-19937">Specifically, we use the entire corpus, create a single, unified phrase table and then use the statistical measures mentioned above, and in particular cross-entropy, as a clue for selecting phrase pairs from this table.</S>
        <S ID="S-19938">The benefit of this method is that not only does it yield the best results, but it also eliminates the need to directly predict the direction of translation of the parallel corpus.</S>
        <S ID="S-19939">The main contribution of this work, therefore, is a methodology that improves the quality of SMT by building translation models that are adapted to the nature of translationese.</S>

        <S ID="S-19941">Their main finding is that using the S &#8594; T portion of the parallel corpus results in mucqqh better translation quality than when the T &#8594; S portion is used for training the translation model.</S>

        <S ID="S-19949">Our current work is closely related to research in domain-adaptation.</S>
        <S ID="S-19950">In a typical domain adaptation scenario, a system is trained on a large corpus of &#8220;general&#8221; (out-of-domain) training material, with a small portion of in-domain training texts.</S>
        <S ID="S-19951">In our case, the translation model is trained on a large parallel corpus, of which some (generally unknown) subset is &#8220;in-domain&#8221; (S &#8594; T ), and some other subset is &#8220;out-of-domain&#8221; (T &#8594; S).</S>
        <S ID="S-19952">Most existing adaptation methods focus on selecting in-domain data from a general domain corpus.</S>
        <S ID="S-19953">In particular, perplexity is used to score the sentences in the general-domain corpus according to an in-domain language model.</S>

        <S ID="S-19957">Domain adaptation methods are usually applied at the corpus level, while we focus on an adaptation of the phrase table used for SMT.</S>
        <S ID="S-19958">In this sense, our work follows <REF ID="R-10" RPTR="18">Foster et al. (2010)</REF><REF ID="R-14" RPTR="24">(2010)</REF>, who weigh out-of-domain phrase pairs according to their relevance to the target domain.</S>
        <S ID="S-19959">They use multiple features that help distinguish between phrase pairs in the general domain and those in the specific domain.</S>
        <S ID="S-19960">We rely on features that are motivated by the findings of Translation Studies, having established their relevance through a comparative analysis of the phrase tables.</S>
        <S ID="S-19961">In particular, we use measures such as translation model entropy, inspired by Koehn et al. <REF ID="R-07" RPTR="12">(2009)</REF><REF ID="R-21" RPTR="35">(2009)</REF><REF ID="R-24" RPTR="45">(2009)</REF>.</S>

        <S ID="S-19963">The tasks we focus on are translation between French and English, in both directions.</S>
        <S ID="S-19964">We use the Hansard corpus, containing transcripts of the Canadian parliament from 1996&#8211;2007, as the source of all parallel data.</S>
        <S ID="S-19965">The Hansard is a bilingual French&#8211;English corpus comprising approximately 80% English-original texts and 20% French-original texts.</S>
        <S ID="S-19966">Crucially, each sentence pair in the corpus is annotated with the direction of translation.</S>
        <S ID="S-19967">Both English and French are lowercased and tokenized using MOSES (Koehn et al., 2007).</S>
        <S ID="S-19968">Sentences longer than 80 words are discarded.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-19969">To address the effect of the corpus size, we compile six subsets of different sizes (250K, 500K, 750K, 1M, 1.25M and 1.5M parallel sentences) from each portion (English-original and French-original) of the corpus.</S>
        <S ID="S-19970">Additionally, we use the devtest section of the Hansard corpus to randomly select French-original and English-original sentences that are used for tuning (1,000 sentences each) and evaluation (5,000 sentences each).</S>
        <S ID="S-19971">French-to-English MT systems are tuned and tested on French-original sentences and English-to-French systems on Englishoriginal ones.</S>

        <S ID="S-19973">We use GIZA++ (<REF ID="R-30" RPTR="60">Och and Ney, 2000</REF>) with grow-diagfinal alignment, and extract phrases of length up to 10 words.</S>
        <S ID="S-19974">We prune the resulting phrase tables as in <REF ID="R-15" RPTR="27">Johnson et al. (2007)</REF>, using at most 30 translations per source phrase and discarding singleton phrase pairs.</S>

        <S ID="S-19995">A large number of unique source phrases suggests better coverage of the source text, while a small number of translations per source phrase means a lower phrase table entropy.</S>

        <S ID="S-20025">They have lower entropy and cross-entropy, but higher covering set length.</S>
        <S ID="S-20026">In order to asses the correspondence of each measure to translation quality, we compute the correlation of BLEU scores from Table 1 with each of the measures specified in Table 2; we compute the correlation coefficient R 2 (the square of Pearson&#8217;s product-moment correlation coefficient) by fitting a simple linear regression model.</S>
        <S ID="S-20027">Table 3 lists the results.</S>
        <S ID="S-20028">Only the covering set cross-entropy measure shows stability over the French-to-English and English-to-French translation tasks, with R 2 equals to 0.56 and 0.54, respectively.</S>
        <S ID="S-20029">Other measures are sensitive to the translation task: covering set entropy has the highest correlation with BLEU (R 2 = 0.94) when translating French-to-English, but it drops to 0.46 for the reverse task.</S>
        <S ID="S-20030">The covering set average length measure shows similar behavior: R 2 drops from 0.75 in French-to-English to 0.56 in Englishto-French.</S>

      <P>
        <S ID="S-20037">We have thus established the fact that S &#8594; T phrase tables have an advantage over T &#8594; S ones that stems directly from the different characteristics of original and translated texts.</S>
        <S ID="S-20038">We have also identified three statistical measures that explain most of the variability in translation quality.</S>
        <S ID="S-20039">We now explore ways for taking advantage of the entire parallel corpus, including translations in both directions, in light of the above findings.</S>
        <S ID="S-20040">Our goal is to establish the best method to address the issue of different translation direction components in the parallel corpus.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-20041">First, we simply take the union of the two subsets of the parallel corpus.</S>
        <S ID="S-20042">We create three different mixtures of FO and EO: 500K sentences each of FO and EO (&#8216;MIX1&#8217;), 500K sentences of FO and 1M sentences of EO (&#8216;MIX2&#8217;), and 1M sentences of FO and 500K sentences of EO (&#8216;MIX3&#8217;).</S>

        <S ID="S-20051">Even with a corpus several times as large, however, the &#8216;mixed&#8217; MT systems perform only slightly better than the S &#8594; T ones.</S>
        <S ID="S-20052">On one hand, this means that one can train MT systems on S &#8594; T data only, at the expense of only a minor loss in quality.</S>
        <S ID="S-20053">On the other hand, it is obvious that the T &#8594; S component also contributes to translation quality.</S>

        <S ID="S-20058">Consequently, improving covering set cross-entropy has the greatest potential for improving translation quality.</S>
        <S ID="S-20059">We therefore use this feature to &#8216;encourage&#8217; the decoder to</S>

        <S ID="S-20060">select translation options that are more related to the genre of translated texts.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-20061">We do so by adding to each phrase pair in the phrase tables an additional factor, as a measure of its fitness to the genre of translationese.</S>
        <S ID="S-20062">We experiment with two such factors.</S>
        <S ID="S-20063">First, we use the language models described in Section 4 to compute the cross-entropy of each translation option according to this model.</S>
        <S ID="S-20064">We add cross-entropy as an additional score of a translation pair that can be tuned by MERT (we refer to this system as CrEnt).</S>
        <S ID="S-20065">Since cross-entropy is &#8216;the lower the better&#8217; metric, we adjust the range of values used by MERT for this score to be negative.</S>
        <S ID="S-20066">Second, following <REF ID="R-28" RPTR="58">Moore and Lewis (2010)</REF><REF ID="R-14" RPTR="26">(2010)</REF>, we define an adapting feature that not only measures how close phrases are to translated language, but also how far they are from original language, and use it as a factor in a phrase table (this system is referred to as PplRatio).</S>
        <S ID="S-20067">We build two additional language models of original texts as follows.</S>
        <S ID="S-20068">For original English, we extract 135,000 English-original sentences from the English portion of Europarl, and 2,700 English-original sentences from the Hansard corpus.</S>
        <S ID="S-20069">We train a trigram language model with interpolated modified Kneser-Ney discounting on each corpus and we interpolate both models to minimize the perplexity of the source side of the development set for the English-to-French translation task (&#955; = 0.49).</S>
        <S ID="S-20070">For original French, we use 110,000 sentences from Europarl and 2,900 sentences from Hansard, &#955; = 0.61.</S>
        <S ID="S-20071">Finally, for each target phrase t in the phrase table we compute the ratio of the perplexity of t according to the original language model L o and the perplexity of t with respect to the translated model L t (see Section 4).</S>
        <S ID="S-20072">In other words, the factor F is computed as follows:</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-20073">F (t) = H(t, L o) H(t, L t ) (4)</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-20074">We apply these techniques to the French-to- English and English-to-French phrase tables built from the mixed corpora and use each phrase table to train an SMT system.</S>
        <S ID="S-20075">Table 6 summarizes the performance of these systems.</S>
        <S ID="S-20076">All systems outperform the corresponding Union systems.</S>
        <S ID="S-20077">&#8216;CrEnt&#8217; systems show significant improvements (p &lt; 0.05) on balanced scenarios (&#8216;MIX1&#8217;) and on scenarios biased towards the S &#8594; T component (&#8216;MIX2&#8217; in the French-to-English task, &#8216;MIX3&#8217; in English-to-French).</S>
        <S ID="S-20078">&#8216;PplRatio&#8217; systems exhibit more consistent behavior, showing small, but statistically significant improvement (p &lt; 0.05) in all scenarios.</S>

        <S ID="S-20083">We compare translations produced by the &#8216;Union&#8217; (henceforth baseline) and by the &#8216;PplRatio&#8217; (henceforth adapted) French-English SMT systems.</S>
        <S ID="S-20084">We manually inspect 200 sentences of length between 15 and 25 from the French-English evaluation set.</S>
        <S ID="S-20085">In many cases, the adapted system produces more fluent and accurate translations.</S>
        <S ID="S-20086">In the following examples, the baseline system generates common translations of French words that are adequate for a wider context, whereas the adapted system chooses less common, but more suitable translations: Source J&#8217;ai eu cette perception et j&#8217;&#233;tais assez</S>

        <S ID="S-20099">In quite a few cases, the baseline system leaves out important words from the source sentence, producing ungrammatical, even illegible translations, whereas the adapted system generates good translations.</S>

      <HEADER>7 Conclusion</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-20133">Phrase tables trained on parallel corpora that were translated in the same direction as the translation task perform better than ones trained on corpora translated in the opposite direction.</S>
        <S ID="S-20134">Nonetheless, even &#8216;wrong&#8217; phrase tables contribute to the translation quality.</S>
        <S ID="S-20135">We analyze both &#8216;correct&#8217; and &#8216;wrong&#8217; phrase tables, uncovering a great deal of difference between them.</S>
        <S ID="S-20136">We use insights from Translation Studies to explain these differences; we then adapt the translation model to the nature of translationese.</S>
        <S ID="S-20137">We incorporate information-theoretic measures that correlate well with translationese into phrase tables as an additional score that can be tuned by MERT, and show a statistically significant improvement in the translation quality over all baseline systems.</S>
        <S ID="S-20138">We also analyze the results qualitatively, showing that SMT systems adapted to translationese tend to produce more coherent and fluent outputs than the baseline systems.</S>
        <S ID="S-20139">An additional advantage of our approach is that it does not require an annotation of the translation direction of the parallel corpus.</S>
        <S ID="S-20140">It is completely generic and can be applied to any language pair, domain or corpus.</S>
        <S ID="S-20141">This work can be extended in various directions.</S>
        <S ID="S-20142">We plan to further explore the use of two phrase tables, one for each direction-determined subset of the parallel corpus.</S>
        <S ID="S-20143">Specifically, we will interpolate the translation models as in <REF ID="R-09" RPTR="17">Foster and Kuhn (2007)</REF>, including a maximum a posteriori combination (Bacchiani et al., 2006).</S>
        <S ID="S-20144">We also plan to upweight the S &#8594; T subset of the parallel corpus and train a single phrase table on the concatenated corpus.</S>
        <S ID="S-20145">Finally, we intend to extend this work by combining the translation-model adaptation we present here with the language-model adaptation suggested by Lembersky et al. <REF ID="R-00" RPTR="4">(2011)</REF><REF ID="R-26" RPTR="54">(2011)</REF> in a unified system that is more tuned to generating translationese.</S>
