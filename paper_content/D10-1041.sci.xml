  <ABSTRACT>
    <A-S ID="S-9459">For resource-limited language pairs, coverage of the test set by the parallel corpus is an important factor that affects translation quality in two respects: 1) out of vocabulary words; 2) the same information in an input sentence can be expressed in different ways, while current phrase-based SMT systems cannot automatically select an alternative way to transfer the same information.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-9460">Therefore, given limited data, in order to facilitate translation from the input side, this paper proposes a novel method to reduce the translation difficulty using source-side lattice-based paraphrases.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-9461">We utilise the original phrases from the input sentence and the corresponding paraphrases to build a lattice with estimated weights for each edge to improve translation quality.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-9462">Compared to the baseline system, our method achieves relative improvements of 7.07%, 6.78% and 3.63% in terms of BLEU score on small, medium and largescale English-to-Chinese translation tasks respectively.</A-S>
    <A-S ID="S-9463">The results show that the proposed method is effective not only for resourcelimited language pairs, but also for resourcesufficient pairs to some extent.</A-S>

      <HEADER>1 Introduction</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-9464">In recent years, statistical MT systems have been easy to develop due to the rapid explosion in data availability, especially parallel data.</S>
        <S ID="S-9465">However, in reality there are still many language pairs which lack parallel data, such as Urdu&#8211;English, Chinese&#8211; Italian, where large amounts of speakers exist for both languages; of course, the problem is far worse for pairs such as Catalan&#8211;Irish.</S>
        <S ID="S-9466">For such resourcelimited language pairs, sparse amounts of parallel data would cause the word alignment to be inaccurate, which would in turn lead to an inaccurate phrase alignment, and bad translations would result.</S>
        <S ID="S-9467"><REF ID="R-01" RPTR="0">Callison-Burch et al. (2006)</REF> argue that limited amounts of parallel training data can lead to the problem of low coverage in that many phrases encountered at run-time are not observed in the training data and so their translations will not be learned.</S>
        <S ID="S-9468">Thus, in recent years, research on addressing the problem of unknown words or phrases has become more and more evident for resource-limited language pairs.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-9469"><REF ID="R-01" RPTR="1">Callison-Burch et al. (2006)</REF> proposed a novel method which substitutes a paraphrase for an unknown source word or phrase in the input sentence, and then proceeds to use the translation of that paraphrase in the production of the target-language result.</S>
        <S ID="S-9470">Their experiments showed that by translating paraphrases a marked improvement was achieved in coverage and translation quality, especially in the case of unknown words which previously had been left untranslated.</S>
        <S ID="S-9471">However, on a large-scale data set, they did not achieve improvements in terms of automatic evaluation.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-9472"><REF ID="R-06" RPTR="8">Nakov (2008)</REF> proposed another way to use paraphrases in SMT.</S>
        <S ID="S-9473">He generates nearly-equivalent syntactic paraphrases of the source-side training sentences, then pairs each paraphrased sentence with the target translation associated with the original sentence in the training data.</S>
        <S ID="S-9474">Essentially, this method generates new training data using paraphrases to train a new model and obtain more useful</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-9475">phrase pairs.</S>
        <S ID="S-9476">However, he reported that this method results in bad system performance.</S>
        <S ID="S-9477">By contrast, real improvements can be achieved by merging the phrase tables of the paraphrase model and the original model, giving priority to the latter.</S>
        <S ID="S-9478"><REF ID="R-10" RPTR="14">Schroeder et al. (2009)</REF> presented the use of word lattices for multi-source translation, in which the multiple source input texts are compiled into a compact lattice, over which a single decoding pass is then performed.</S>
        <S ID="S-9479">This lattice-based method achieved positive results across all data conditions.</S>
        <S ID="S-9480">In this paper, we propose a novel method using paraphrases to facilitate translation, especially for resource-limited languages.</S>
        <S ID="S-9481">Our method does not distinguish unknown words in the input sentence, but uses paraphrases of all possible words and phrases in the source input sentence to build a source-side lattice to provide a diverse and flexible list of source-side candidates to the SMT decoder so that it can search for a best path and deliver the translation with the highest probability.</S>
        <S ID="S-9482">In this case, we neither need to change the phrase table, nor add new features in the log-linear model, nor add new sentences in the training data.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-9483">The remainder of this paper is organised as follows.</S>
        <S ID="S-9484">In Section 2, we define the &#8220;translation difficulty&#8221; from the perspective of the source side, and then examine how well the test set is covered by the phrase table and the parallel training data .</S>
        <S ID="S-9485">Section 3 describes our paraphrase lattice method and discusses how to set the weights for the edges in the lattice network.</S>
        <S ID="S-9486">In Section 4, we report comparative experiments conducted on small, medium and largescale English-to-Chinese data sets.</S>
        <S ID="S-9487">In Section 5, we analyse the influence of our paraphrase lattice method.</S>
        <S ID="S-9488">Section 6 concludes and gives avenues for future work.</S>

        <HEADER>2.1 Translation Difficulty</HEADER>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-9489">We use the term &#8220;translation difficulty&#8221; to explain how difficult it is to translate the source-side sentence in three respects:</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-9490">&#8226; The OOV rates of the source sentences in the test set (<REF ID="R-01" RPTR="2">Callison-Burch et al., 2006</REF>).</S>

        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-9492">sentence.</S>
          <S ID="S-9493">Some particular grammatical structures on the source side cannot be directly translated into the corresponding structures on the target side.</S>
          <S ID="S-9494"><REF ID="R-06" RPTR="9">Nakov (2008)</REF> presents an example showing how hard it is to translate an English construction into Spanish.</S>
          <S ID="S-9495">Assume that an English-to-Spanish SMT system has an entry in its phrase table for &#8220;inequality of income&#8221;, but not for &#8220;income inequality&#8221;.</S>
          <S ID="S-9496">He argues that the latter phrase is hard to translate into Spanish where noun compounds are rare: the correct translation in this case requires a suitable Spanish preposition and a reordering, which are hard for the system to realize properly in the target language (Nakov, 2008).</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-9497">&#8226; Consistency between the reference and the target-side sentence in the training corpus.</S>
          <S ID="S-9498"><REF ID="R-06" RPTR="10">Nakov (2008)</REF> points out that if the target-side sentence in the parallel corpus is inconsistent with the reference of the test set, then in some cases, a test sentence might contain pieces that are equivalent, but syntactically different from the phrases learned in training, which might result in practice in a missed opportunity for a high-quality translation.</S>
          <S ID="S-9499">In this case, if we use paraphrases for these pieces of text, then we might improve the opportunity for the translation to approach the reference, especially in the case where only one reference is available.</S>
        </P>

        <HEADER>2.2 Coverage</HEADER>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-9500">As to the first aspect &#8211; coverage &#8211; we argue that the coverage rate of the new words or unknown words are more and more becoming a &#8220;bottleneck&#8221; for resource-limited languages.</S>
          <S ID="S-9501">Furthermore, current SMT systems, either phrase-based (<REF ID="R-03" RPTR="7">Koehn et al., 2003</REF>; <REF ID="R-02" RPTR="6">Chiang, 2005</REF>) or syntax-based (<REF ID="R-14" RPTR="18">Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006</REF>), use phrases as the fundamental translation unit, so how much the phrase table and training data can cover the test set is an important factor which influences the translation quality.</S>
          <S ID="S-9502">Table 1 shows the statistics of the coverage of the test set on English-to-Chinese FBIS data, where we can see that the coverage of unigrams is very high, especially when the data is increased to the medium size (200K), where unigram coverage is greater than 90%.</S>
          <S ID="S-9503">Based on the observations of the unknown un-</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-9504">igrams, we found that most are named entities (NEs) such as person name, location name, etc. From the bigram phrases, the coverage rates begin to significantly decline.</S>
          <S ID="S-9505">It can also be seen that phrases containing more than 5 words rarely appear either in the phrase table or in the parallel corpus, which indicates that data sparseness is severe for long phrases.</S>
          <S ID="S-9506">Even if the size of the corpus is significantly increased (e.g. from 20K to 200K), the coverage of long phrases is still quite low.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-9507">With respect to these three aspects of the translation difficulty, especially for data-limited language pairs, we propose a more effective method to make use of the paraphrases to facilitate translation process.</S>

        <HEADER>3.1 Motivation</HEADER>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-9509">Our idea to build a paraphrase lattice for SMT is inspired by the following points:</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-9510">&#8226; Handling unknown words is a challenging issue for SMT, and using paraphrases is an effective way to facilitate this problem (<REF ID="R-01" RPTR="3">Callison-Burch et al., 2006</REF>);</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-9511">&#8226; The method of paraphrase substitution does not show any significant improvement, especially on a large-scale data set in terms of BLEU (<REF ID="R-09" RPTR="13">Papineni et al., 2002</REF>) scores (<REF ID="R-01" RPTR="4">Callison-Burch et al., 2006</REF>);</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-9512">&#8226; Building a paraphrase lattice might provide more translation options to the decoder so that it can flexibly search for the best path.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-9513">The major contributions of our method are:</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-9514">&#8226; We consider all N-gram phrases rather than only unknown phrases in the test set, where {1 &lt;= N &lt;= 10};</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-9515">&#8226; We utilise lattices rather than simple substitution to facilitate the translation process;</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-9516">&#8226; We propose an empirical weight estimation method to set weights for edges in the word lattice, which is detailed in Section 3.4.</S>

        <P>
          <S ID="S-9584">Estimating and normalising the weight for each edge in the word lattice is a challenging issue when the edges come from different sources.</S>
          <S ID="S-9585">In this section, we propose an empirical method to set the weights for the edges by distinguishing the original (&#8220;ORG- E&#8221;) and new (&#8220;NEW-E&#8221;) edges in the lattices.</S>
          <S ID="S-9586">The aim is to utilize the original sentences as the references to weight the edges from paraphrases, so that decoding paths going through &#8220;ORG-E&#8221; edges will tend to have higher scores than those which use &#8220;NEW-E&#8221; ones.</S>
          <S ID="S-9587">The assumption behind this is that the paraphrases are alternatives for the original sentences, so decoding paths going though them ought to be penalised.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-9588">Therefore, for all the &#8220;ORG-E&#8221; edges, their weights in the lattice are set to 1.0 as the reference.</S>
          <S ID="S-9589">Thus, in the log-linear model, decoding paths going though these edges are not penalised because they do not come from the paraphrases.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-9590">By contrast, &#8220;NEW-E&#8221; are divided into two groups for the calculation of weights:</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-9591">&#8226; For &#8220;NEW-E&#8221; edges which are outgoing edges of the lattice nodes that come from the original sentences, the probabilities p(e s |e i ) 2 of their</S>

        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-9602">where k is a predefined parameter to trade off between decoding speed and the number of potential paraphrases being considered.</S>
          <S ID="S-9603">Thus, once a decoding path goes though one of these edges, it will be penalised according to its paraphrase probabilities.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-9604">&#8226; For all other &#8220;NEW-E&#8221; edges, their weights are set to 1.0, because the paraphrase penalty has been counted in their preceding &#8220;NEW-E&#8221; edges.</S>

          <S ID="S-9610">As specified previously, &#8220;ORG- E&#8221; edges are all weighted by 1.0 (e.g. edge labeled &#8220;the&#8221; from node 0 to 1).</S>
          <S ID="S-9611">By contrast, &#8220;NEW-E&#8221; edges in the first group are weighted by equation (4) (e.g. edges in dashed lines start from node 0 to node 2 and 8), while others in the second group are weighted by 1.0 (e.g. edge labeled &#8220;training&#8221; from node 8 to 2).</S>
          <S ID="S-9612">Note that penalties of the paths going through paraphrases are counted by equation (4), which is represented by the weights of &#8220;NEW- E&#8221; edges in the first group.</S>
          <S ID="S-9613">For example, starting from node 2, paths going to node 9 and 10 are penalised because lattice weights are also considered in the log-linear model.</S>
          <S ID="S-9614">However, other edges do not imply penalties since their weights are set to 1.0.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-9615">The reason to set all weights for the &#8220;ORG-E&#8221; edges to a uniform weight (e.g. 1.0) instead of a lower empirical weight is to avoid excessive penalties for the original words.</S>
          <S ID="S-9616">For example, in Figure 2, the original edge from node 3 to 4 (continue) has a weight of 1.0, so the paths going though the original edges from node 2 to 4 (will continue) have a higher lattice score (1.0 &#215; 1.0 = 1.0) than the paths going through the edges of paraphrases (e.g. will resume (score: 0.125 &#215; 1.0 = 0.125) and will go (score: 0.11 &#215; 1.0 = 0.11)), or any other mixed paths that goes through original edges and paraphrase edges, such as will continuous (score: 1.0 &#215; 0.125 = 0.125).</S>
          <S ID="S-9617">The point is that we should have more trust when translating the original words, but if we penalise (set weights &lt; 1.0) the &#8220;ORG- E&#8221; edges whenever there is a paraphrase for them, then when considering the context of the lattice, paraphrases will be favoured systematically.</S>
          <S ID="S-9618">That is why we just penalise the &#8220;NEW-E&#8221; edges in the first group and set other weights to 1.0.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-9619">As to unknown words in the input sentence, even if we give them a prioritised weight, they would be severely penalised in the decoding process.</S>
          <S ID="S-9620">So we do not need to distinguish unknown words when building and weighting the paraphrase lattice.</S>

          <S ID="S-9645">Therefore, in order to reduce the complexity of the lattice and increase decoding speed, we must filter out some potential noise in the paraphrase table.</S>

        <P>
          <S ID="S-9655">The experimental results conducted on small and medium-sized data sets are shown in Table 2.</S>
          <S ID="S-9656">The 95% confidence intervals (CI) for BLEU scores are independently computed on each of three systems, while the &#8220;pair-CI 95%&#8221; are computed relative to the baseline system only for &#8220;Para-Sub&#8221; and &#8220;Lattice&#8221; systems.</S>
          <S ID="S-9657">All the significance tests use bootstrap and paired-bootstrap resampling normal approximation methods (<REF ID="R-13" RPTR="17">Zhang and Vogel, 2004</REF>).</S>
          <S ID="S-9658">8 Improvements are considered to be significant if the left boundary of the confidence interval is larger than zero in terms of the &#8220;pair-CI 95%&#8221;.</S>
          <S ID="S-9659">It can be seen that 1) our &#8220;Lattice&#8221; system outperforms the baseline by 1.02 and 1.6 absolute (7.07% and 6.78% relative) BLEU points in terms of the 20K and 200K data sets respectively, and our system also decreases the TER scores by 2.24 and 1.19 (2.97% and 1.87% relative) points than the baseline system.</S>
          <S ID="S-9660">In terms of the &#8220;pair-CI 95%&#8221;, the left boundaries for 20K and 200K data are respectively &#8220;+0.74&#8221; and &#8220;+1.19&#8221;, which indicate that the &#8220;Lattice&#8221; system is significantly better than the baseline system on these two data sets.</S>
          <S ID="S-9661">2) The &#8220;Para-Sub&#8221; system performs slightly better (0.36 absolute BLEU points) than the baseline system on the 20K data set, but slightly worse (0.19 absolute BLEU points) than the baseline on the 200K data set, which indicates that the paraphrase substitution method used in (<REF ID="R-01" RPTR="5">Callison-Burch et al., 2006</REF>) does not work on resource-sufficient data sets.</S>
          <S ID="S-9662">In terms of the &#8220;pair-CI 95%&#8221;, the left boundary for 20K data is &#8220;+0.13&#8221;, which indicates that it is significantly better than the baseline system, while the left boundary is &#8220;-0.46&#8221; for 200K data, which indicates that the &#8220;Para-Sub&#8221; system is significantly worse than the baseline system.</S>

          <S ID="S-9665">4) In terms of the two metrics, our proposed method achieves the best performance, which shows that our method is effective and consistent on different sizes of data.</S>
          <S ID="S-9666">In order to verify our method on large-scale data, we also perform experiments on 2.1 million sentence-pairs of English-to-Chinese data as described in Section 4.1.</S>
          <S ID="S-9667">The results are shown in Table 3.</S>
          <S ID="S-9668">From Table 3, it can be seen that the &#8220;Lattice&#8221; system achieves an improvement of 0.51 absolute (3.63% relative) BLEU points and a decrease of 1.6 absolute (2.14% relative) TER points compared to the baseline.</S>
          <S ID="S-9669">In terms of the &#8220;pair-CI 95%&#8221;, the left boundary for the &#8220;Lattice&#8221; system is &#8220;+0.15&#8221; which indicates that it is significantly better than the baseline system in terms of BLEU.</S>
          <S ID="S-9670">Interestingly, in our experiment, the &#8220;Para-Sub&#8221; system also outperforms the baseline on those three automatic metrics.</S>
          <S ID="S-9671">However, in terms of the &#8220;pair-CI 95%&#8221;, the left boundary for the &#8220;Para-Sub&#8221; system is &#8220;-0.18&#8221; which indicates that it is not significantly better than the baseline system in terms of BLEU.</S>
          <S ID="S-9672">The results also show that our proposed method is effective and consistent even on a large-scale data set.</S>
          <S ID="S-9673">It also can be seen that the improvement on 2.1 million sentence-pairs is less than that of the 20K and 200K data sets.</S>
          <S ID="S-9674">That is, as the size of the training data increases, the problems of data sparseness decrease, so that the coverage of the test set by the parallel corpus will correspondingly increase.</S>
          <S ID="S-9675">In this case, the role of paraphrases in decoding becomes a little weaker.</S>
          <S ID="S-9676">On the other hand, it might become a kind of noise to interfere with the exact translation of the original source-side phrases when decoding.</S>
          <S ID="S-9677">Therefore, our proposed method may be more appropriate for language pairs with limited resources.</S>

          <S ID="S-9683">These results show that 1) most of the paraphrases that are added in are lower-order n-grams; 2) the paraphrases can increase the coverage of the input by handling the unknown words to some extent.</S>

        <HEADER>5.2 Analysis on Translation Results</HEADER>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-9689">In this section, we give an example to show the effectiveness of using paraphrase lattices to deal with unknown words.</S>
          <S ID="S-9690">The example is evaluated according to both automatic evaluation and human evaluation at sentence level.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-9691">See Figure 3 as an illustration of how the paraphrase-based systems process unknown words.</S>
          <S ID="S-9692">According to the word alignments between the source-side sentence and the reference, the word &#8220;disarmed&#8221; is translated into two Chinese words &#8220;d d&#8221; and &#8220;dd&#8221;.</S>
          <S ID="S-9693">These two Chinese words are discontinuous in the reference, so it is difficult for the PB-SMT system to correctly translate the single English word into a discontinuous Chinese phrase.</S>
          <S ID="S-9694">In fact in this example, &#8220;disarmed&#8221; is an unknown word and it is kept untranslated in the result of the baseline system.</S>
          <S ID="S-9695">In the &#8220;Para-Sub&#8221; system, it is translated into &#8220;dd&#8221; based on a paraphrase pair P P 1 = &#8220;disarmed &#8741; disarmament &#8741; 0.087&#8221; and its translation pair T 1 = &#8220;disarmament &#8741; dd&#8221;.</S>
          <S ID="S-9696">The number &#8220;0.087&#8221; is the probability p 1 that indicates to what extent these two words are paraphrases.</S>
          <S ID="S-9697">It can be seen that although &#8220;dd&#8221; is quite different from the meaning of &#8220;disarmed&#8221;, it is understandable for human in some sense.</S>
          <S ID="S-9698">In the &#8220;Lattice&#8221; system, the word &#8220;disarmed&#8221; is translated into three Chinese words &#8220;d dd dd&#8221; based on a paraphrase pair P P 2 = &#8220;disarmed &#8741; demilitarized &#8741; 0.099&#8221; and its translation pair T 2 = &#8220;demilitarized &#8741; d dd d d&#8221;.</S>
          <S ID="S-9699">The probability p 2 is slightly greater than p 1 .</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-9700">We argue that the reason that the &#8220;Lattice&#8221; system selects P P 2 and T 2 rather than P P 1 and T 1 is because of the weight estimation in the lattice.</S>
          <S ID="S-9701">That is, P P 2 is more prioritised, while P P 1 is more penalised based on equation (4).</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-9702">From the viewpoint of human evaluation, the paraphrase pair P P 2 is more appropriate than P P 1 , and the translation T 2 is more similar to the original meaning than T 1 .</S>
          <S ID="S-9703">The sentence-level automatic evaluation scores for this example in terms of BLEU and TER metrics are shown in Table 5.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-9704">The BLEU score of the &#8220;Lattice&#8221; system is much higher than the baseline, and the TER score is quite a bit lower than the baseline.</S>
          <S ID="S-9705">Therefore, from the viewpoint of automatic evaluation, the translation from the &#8220;Lattice&#8221; system is also better than those from the baseline and &#8220;Para-Sub&#8221; systems.</S>

      <HEADER>6 Conclusions and Future Work</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-9707">In this paper, we proposed a novel method using paraphrase lattices to facilitate the translation process in SMT.</S>
        <S ID="S-9708">Given an input sentence, our method firstly discovers all possible paraphrases from a paraphrase database for N-grams (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 10) in the test set, and then filters out the paraphrases which do not appear in the phrase table in order to avoid adding new unknown words on the input side.</S>
        <S ID="S-9709">We then use the original words and the paraphrases to build a word lattice, and set the weights to prioritise the original edges and penalise the paraphrase edges.</S>
        <S ID="S-9710">Finally, we import the lattice into the decoder to perform lattice decoding.</S>
        <S ID="S-9711">The experiments are conducted on English-to-Chinese translation using the FBIS data set with small and medium-sized amounts of data, and on a large-scale corpus of 2.1 428 million sentence pairs.</S>
        <S ID="S-9712">We also performed comparative experiments for the baseline, the &#8220;Para-Sub&#8221; system and our paraphrase lattice-based system.</S>
        <S ID="S-9713">The experimental results show that our proposed system significantly outperforms the baseline and the &#8220;Para- Sub&#8221; system, and the effectiveness is consistent on the small, medium and large-scale data sets.</S>
        <S ID="S-9714">As for future work, firstly we plan to propose a pruning algorithm for the duplicate paths in the lattice, which will track the edge generation with respect to the path span, and thus eliminate duplicate paths.</S>
        <S ID="S-9715">Secondly, we plan to experiment with another feature function in the log-linear model to discount words derived from paraphrases, and use MERT to assign an appropriate weight to this feature function.</S>
