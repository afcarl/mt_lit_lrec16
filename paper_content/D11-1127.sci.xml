        <S ID="S-11518">Hierarchical phrase-based translation, using a synchronous context-free translation grammar (SCFG) together with an n-gram target language model (LM), is a popular approach in machine translation (<REF ID="R-08" RPTR="15">Chiang, 2007</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-11519">Given a SCFG G and an n- gram language model M, this paper focuses on how to decode with them, i.e. how to apply them to the source text to generate a target translation.</S>
        <S ID="S-11520">Decoding has three basic steps, which we first describe in terms of the formal languages and relations involved, with data representations and algorithms to follow.</S>

      <P>
        <S ID="S-11530">Of course, decoding requires explicit data representations and algorithms for combining and searching them.</S>
        <S ID="S-11531">In common to the approaches we will consider here, s is applied to G by using the CYK algorithm in Step 1 and M is represented by a finite automaton in Step 2.</S>
        <S ID="S-11532">The choice of the representation of T in many ways determines the remaining decoder representations and algorithms needed.</S>
        <S ID="S-11533">Since {s} is a finite language and we assume throughout that G does not allow unbounded insertions, T and L are, in fact, regular languages.</S>
        <S ID="S-11534">As such, T and L have finite automaton representations T f and L f .</S>
        <S ID="S-11535">In this case, weighted finite-state intersection and single-source shortest path algorithms (using negative log probabilities) can be used to solve Steps 2 and 3 (<REF ID="R-22" RPTR="29">Mohri, 2009</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-11536">This is the approach taken in (Iglesias et al., 2009a; de Gispert et al., 2010).</S>
        <S ID="S-11537">Instead T and L can be represented by hypergraphs T h and L h (or very similarly context-free rules, and-or trees, or deductive systems).</S>
        <S ID="S-11538">In this case, hypergraph intersection with a finite automaton and hypergraph shortest path algorithms can be used to solve Steps 2 and 3 (<REF ID="R-15" RPTR="22">Huang, 2008</REF>).</S>
        <S ID="S-11539">This is the approach taken by <REF ID="R-08" RPTR="11">Chiang (2007)</REF>.</S>
        <S ID="S-11540">In this paper, we will consider another representation for context-free languages T and L as well, pushdown automata (PDA) T p and L p , familiar from formal</S>

        <S ID="S-11542">We will describe PDA intersection with a finite automaton and PDA shortest-path algorithms in Section 2 that can be used to solve Steps 2 and 3.</S>
        <S ID="S-11543">It cannot be over-emphasized that the CFG, hypergraph and PDA representations of T are used for their compactness rather than for expressing non-regular languages.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-11544">As presented so far, the search performed in Step 3 is admissible (or exact) &#8211; the true shortest path is found.</S>
        <S ID="S-11545">However, the search space in MT can be quite large.</S>
        <S ID="S-11546">Many systems employ aggressive pruning during the shortest-path computation with little theoretical or empirical guarantees of correctness.</S>
        <S ID="S-11547">Further, such pruning can greatly complicate any complexity analysis of the underlying representations and algorithms.</S>
        <S ID="S-11548">In this paper, we will exclude any inadmissible pruning in the shortest-path algorithm itself.</S>
        <S ID="S-11549">This allows us in Section 3 to compare the computational complexity of using these different representations.</S>
        <S ID="S-11550">We show that the PDA representation is particularly suited for decoding with large SCFGs and compact LMs.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-11551">We present Chinese-English translation results under the FSA and PDA translation representations.</S>
        <S ID="S-11552">We describe a two-pass translation strategy which we have developed to allow use of the PDA representation in large-scale translation.</S>
        <S ID="S-11553">In the first pass, translation is done using a lattice-generating version of the shortest path algorithm.</S>
        <S ID="S-11554">The full translation grammar is used but with a compact, entropy-pruned version (Stolcke, 1998) of the full language model.</S>
        <S ID="S-11555">This first-step uses admissible pruning and lattice generation under the compact language model.</S>
        <S ID="S-11556">In the second pass, the original, unpruned LM is simply applied to the lattices produced in the first pass.</S>
        <S ID="S-11557">We find that entropy-pruning and first-pass translation can be done so as to introduce very few search errors in the overall process; we can identify search errors in this experiment by comparison to exact translation under the full translation grammar and language model using the FSA representation.</S>
        <S ID="S-11558">We then investigate a translation grammar which is large enough that exact translation under the FSA representation is not possible.</S>
        <S ID="S-11559">We find that translation is possible using the two-pass strategy with the PDA translation representation and that gains in BLEU score result from using the larger translation grammar.</S>

          <S ID="S-11509">There is extensive prior work on computational efficiency and algorithmic complexity in hierarchical phrase-based translation.</S>
          <S ID="S-11510">The challenge is to find algorithms that can be made to work with large translation grammars and large language models.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-11511">Following the original algorithms and analysis of <REF ID="R-08" RPTR="12">Chiang (2007)</REF>, <REF ID="R-13" RPTR="20">Huang and Chiang (2007)</REF><REF ID="R-08" RPTR="13">Chiang (2007)</REF> developed the cube-growing algorithm, and more recently Huang and Mi (2010) developed an incremental decoding approach that exploits left-to-right nature of the language models.</S>
          <S ID="S-11512">Search errors in hierarchical translation, and in translation more generally, have not been as extensively studied; this is undoubtedly due to the difficulties inherent in finding exact translations for use in comparison.</S>
          <S ID="S-11513">Using a relatively simple phrasebased translation grammar, Iglesias et al. (2009b) compared search via cube-pruning to an exact FST implementation (<REF ID="R-20" RPTR="26">Kumar et al., 2006</REF>) and found that cube-pruning suffered significant search errors.</S>
          <S ID="S-11514">For Hiero translation, an extensive comparison of search errors between the cube pruning and FSA implementation was presented by Iglesias et al. (2009a) and de Gispert et al. (2010).</S>
          <S ID="S-11515">Relaxation techniques have also recently been shown to finding exact solutions in parsing (<REF ID="R-18" RPTR="24">Koo et al., 2010</REF>) and in SMT with tree-to-string translation grammars and trigram language models (<REF ID="R-28" RPTR="38">Rush and Collins, 2011</REF>), much smaller models compared to the work presented in this paper.</S>
          <S ID="S-11516">Although entropy-pruned language models have been used to produce real-time translation systems (<REF ID="R-27" RPTR="37">Prasad et al., 2007</REF>), we believe our use of entropy-pruned language models in two-pass translation to be novel.</S>
          <S ID="S-11517">This is an approach that is widelyused in automatic speech recognition (<REF ID="R-21" RPTR="27">Ljolje et al., 1999</REF>) and we note that it relies on efficient representation of very large search spaces T for subsequent rescoring, as is possible with FSAs and PDAs.</S>

        <S ID="S-11862">This is because M1 &#952; is 10% of the size of the original language model M 1 , as shown in Table 2.</S>
        <S ID="S-11863">As M1 &#952; is further reduced by increasing &#952; (see rows number 3 and 4), decoding time is also reduced.</S>

      <P>
        <S ID="S-11865">Regarding rescoring with the larger M 2 (step 6 in Section 4), the system is also able to match the baseline performance as long as &#946; is wide enough, given the particular M1 &#952; used in first-pass decoding.</S>

        <S ID="S-11892">HiFST fails to decode mainly because the expansion into an FST leads to far too big search spaces (e.g. fails 938 times under &#952; = 7.5 &#215; 10 &#8722;8 ).</S>
        <S ID="S-11893">If it succeeds in expanding the search space into an FST, the decoder still has to compose with the language model, which is also critical in terms of memory us-</S>

        <S ID="S-11894">age (fails 536 times).</S>
        <S ID="S-11895">In contrast, HiPDT creates a PDA, which is a more compact representation of the search space and allows efficient intersection with the language model before expansion into an FST.</S>
        <S ID="S-11896">Therefore, the memory usage is considerably lower.</S>
        <S ID="S-11897">Nevertheless, the complexity of the language model is critical for the PDA intersection and very specially the PDA expansion into an FST (fails 403 times for &#952; =7.5 &#215; 10 &#8722;8 ).</S>
        <S ID="S-11898">With the algorithms presented in this paper, decoding with PDAs is possible for any translation grammar as long as an entropy pruned LM is used.</S>
        <S ID="S-11899">While this allows exact decoding, it comes at the cost of making decisions based on less complex LMs, although this has been shown to be an adequate strategy when applying compact CFG rulesets.</S>
        <S ID="S-11900">On the other hand, HiFST cannot decode under large translation grammars, thus requiring pruning during lattice construction, but it can apply an unpruned LM in this process.</S>
        <S ID="S-11901">We find that with carefully designed pruning strategies, HiFST can match the performance of HiPDT reported in Table 5.</S>
        <S ID="S-11902">But without pruning in search, expansion directly into an FST would lead to an explosion in terms of memory usage.</S>
        <S ID="S-11903">Of course, without memory constraints both strategies would reach the same performance.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-11904">Overall, these results suggest that HiPDT is more robust than HiFST when using complex hierarchical grammars.</S>
        <S ID="S-11905">Conversely, FSTs might be more efficient for search spaces described by more constrained hierarchical grammars.</S>
        <S ID="S-11906">This suggests that a hybrid solution could be effective: we could use PDAs or FSTs e.g. depending on the number of states of the FST representing the expanded search space, or other conditions.</S>
