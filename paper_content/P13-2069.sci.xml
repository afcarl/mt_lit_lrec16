        <S ID="S-38850">Languages are structured data.</S>
        <S ID="S-38851">The proper handling of linguistic structures (such as word order) has been one of the most important yet most challenging tasks in statistical machine translation (SMT).</S>
        <S ID="S-38852">It is important because it has significant impact on human judgment of Machine Translation (MT) quality: an MT output without structure is just like a bag of words.</S>
        <S ID="S-38853">It is also very challenging due to the lack of effective methods to model the structural difference between source and target languages.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-38854">A lot of research has been conducted in this area.</S>
        <S ID="S-38855">Approaches include distance-based penalty function (Koehn et.</S>
        <S ID="S-38856">al. 2003) and lexicalized distortion models such as (Tillman 2004), (Al- Onaizan and Papineni 2006).</S>
        <S ID="S-38857">Because these models are relatively easy to compute, they are widely used in phrase-based SMT systems.</S>
        <S ID="S-38858">Hierarchical phrase-based system (Hiero, Chiang, 2005) utilizes long range reordering information without syntax.</S>
        <S ID="S-38859">Other models use more syntactic information (string-to-tree, treeto-string, tree-to-tree, string-to-dependency etc.) to capture the structural difference between language pairs, including (Yamada and Knight, 2001), (Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006), (Liu et.</S>
        <S ID="S-38860">al. 2006), and (Shen et.</S>
        <S ID="S-38861">al. 2008).</S>
        <S ID="S-38862">These models demonstrate better handling of sentence structures, while the computation is more expensive compared with the distortion-based models.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-38863">In the middle of the spectrum, (Xia and McCord 2004), (Collins et.</S>
        <S ID="S-38864">al 2005), (Wang et.</S>
        <S ID="S-38865">al. 2007), and (Visweswariah et.</S>
        <S ID="S-38866">al. 2010) combined the benefits of the above two strategies: their approaches reorder an input sentence based on a set of reordering rules defined over the source sentence&#8217;s syntax parse tree.</S>
        <S ID="S-38867">As a result, the re-ordered source sentence resembles the word order of its target translation.</S>
        <S ID="S-38868">The reordering rules are either hand-crafted or automatically learned from the training data (source parse trees and bitext word alignments).</S>
        <S ID="S-38869">These rules can be unlexicalized (only including the constituent labels) or fully lexicalized (including both the constituent labels and their head words).</S>
        <S ID="S-38870">The unlexicalized reordering rules are more general and can be applied broadly, but sometimes they are not discriminative enough.</S>
        <S ID="S-38871">In the following English-Chinese reordering rules,</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-38872">the NP and PP nodes are reordered with close to random probabilities.</S>
        <S ID="S-38873">When the constituents are attached with their headwords, the reordering probability is much higher than that of the unlexicalized rules.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-38874">Unfortunately, the application of lexicalized reordering rules is constrained by data sparseness: it is unlikely to train the NP:&lt;noun&gt;</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-38875">PP:&lt;prep&gt; reordering rules for every nounpreposition combination.</S>
        <S ID="S-38876">Even for the learnt lexicalized rules, their counts are also relatively small, thus the reordering probabilities may not be estimated reliably, which could lead to incorrect reordering decisions.</S>
        <S ID="S-38877">To alleviate this problem, we generalize fully lexicalized rules into partially lexicalized rules, which are further generalized into unlexicalized rules.</S>
        <S ID="S-38878">Such generalization allows partial match when the fully lexicalized rules can not be found, thus achieving broader rule coverage.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-38879">Given a node of a source parse tree, we find all the matching rules and consider all their possible reorder permutations.</S>
        <S ID="S-38880">Each permutation has a reordering score, which is the weighted sum of reordering probabilities of all the matching rules.</S>
        <S ID="S-38881">We reorder the child nodes based on the permutation with the highest reordering score.</S>
        <S ID="S-38882">Finally we translate the reordered sentence in a phrase-based SMT system.</S>
        <S ID="S-38883">Our experiments in English to Chinese (EnZh) and English to Japanese (EnJa) translation demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach: we observe consistent improvements across multiple test sets in multiple language pairs and significant gain in human judgment of the MT quality.</S>
        <S ID="S-38884">This paper is organized as follows: in section 2 we briefly introduce the syntax-based reordering technique.</S>
        <S ID="S-38885">In section 3, we describe our approach.</S>
        <S ID="S-38886">In section 4, we show the experiment results, which is followed by conclusion in section 5.</S>

      <HEADER>2 Baseline Syntax-based Reordering</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-38887">In the general syntax-based reordering, reordering is achieved by permuting the children of any interior node in the source parse tree.</S>
        <S ID="S-38888">Although there are cases where reordering is needed across multiple constituents, this still is a simple and effective technique.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-38889">Formally, the reordering rule is a triple {p, lhs, rhs}, where p is the reordering probability, lhs is the left hand side of the rule, i.e., the constituent label sequence of a parse tree node, and rhs is the reordering permutation derived either from handcrafted rules as in (Collins et.</S>
        <S ID="S-38890">al 2005) and (Wang et.</S>
        <S ID="S-38891">al. 2007), or from training data as in (Visweswariah et.</S>
        <S ID="S-38892">al. 2010).</S>
        <S ID="S-38893">The training data includes bilingual sentence pairs with word alignments, as well as the source sentences' parse trees.</S>
        <S ID="S-38894">The children&#8217;s relative order of each node is decided according to their average alignment position in the target sentence.</S>
        <S ID="S-38895">Such relative order is a permutation of the integer sequence [0, 1, &#8230; N-1], where N is the number of children of the given parse node.</S>
        <S ID="S-38896">The counts of each permutation of each parse label sequence will be collected from the training data and converted to probabilities as shown in the examples in Section 1.</S>
        <S ID="S-38897">Finally, only the permutation with the highest probability is selected to reorder the matching parse node.</S>
        <S ID="S-38898">The SMT system is re-trained on reordered training data to translate reordered input sentences.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-38899">Following the above approach, only the reordering rule [0.56 NP PP &#8594; 1 0] is kept in the above example.</S>
        <S ID="S-38900">In other words, all the NP PP phrases will be reordered, even though the reordering is only slightly preferred in all the training data.</S>

      <HEADER>3 Generalized Syntactic Reordering</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-38945">As shown in the previous examples, reordering depends not only on the constituents&#8217; parse labels, but also on the headwords of the constituents.</S>
        <S ID="S-38946">Such fully lexicalized rules suffer from data sparseness: there is either no matching lexicalized rule for a given parse node or the matching rule&#8217;s reordering probability is unreliable.</S>
        <S ID="S-38947">We address the above issues with rule generalization, then consider all the permutations from multi-level rule matching.</S>
      </P>
      <DIV DEPTH="1">
        <HEADER>3.1 Rule Generalization</HEADER>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-38901">Lexicalized rules are applied only when both the constituent labels and headwords match.</S>
          <S ID="S-38902">When only the labels match, these reordering rules are not used.</S>
          <S ID="S-38903">To increase the rule coverage, we generalize the fully lexicalized rules into partially lexicalized and unlexicalized rules.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-38904">We notice that many lexicalized rules share similar reordering permutations, thus it is possible to merge them to form a partially lexicalized rule, where lexicalization only appears at selected constituent&#8217;s headword.</S>
          <S ID="S-38905">Although it is possible to have multiple lexicalizations in a partially lexicalized rule (which will exponentially increase the total number of rules), we observe that most of the time reordering is triggered by a single constituent.</S>
          <S ID="S-38906">Therefore we keep one lexicalization in the partially lexicalized rules.</S>
          <S ID="S-38907">For example, the following lexicalized rule:</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-38908">VB:appeal PP-MNR:by PP-DIR:to --&gt; 1 2 0</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-38909">will be converted into the following 3 partially lexicalized rules:</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-38910">The count of each rule will be the sum of the fully lexicalized rules which can derive the given partially lexicalized rule.</S>
          <S ID="S-38911">In the above preordering rules, &#8220;MNR&#8221; and &#8220;DIR&#8221; are functional labels, indicating the semantic labels (&#8220;manner&#8221;, &#8220;direction&#8221;) of the parse node.</S>
          <S ID="S-38912">We could go even further, converting the partially lexicalized rules into unlexicalized rules.</S>
          <S ID="S-38913">This is similar to the baseline syntax reordering model, although we will keep all their possible permutations and counts for rule matching, as shown below.</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-38914">5 VB PP-MNR PP-DIR --&gt; 2 0 1 22 VB PP-MNR PP-DIR --&gt; 2 1 0 21 VB PP-MNR PP-DIR --&gt; 0 1 2 41 VB PP-MNR PP-DIR --&gt; 1 2 0 35 VB PP-MNR PP-DIR --&gt; 1 0 2</S>
        </P>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-38915">Note that to reduce the noise from paring and word alignment errors, we only keep the reordering rules that appear at least 5 times.</S>
          <S ID="S-38916">Then we convert the counts into probabilities:</S>

        <HEADER>3.2 Multiple Permutation Multi-level Rule Matching</HEADER>
        <P>
          <S ID="S-38925">When applying the three types of reordering rules to reorder a parse tree node, we find all the matching rules and consider all possible permutations.</S>
          <S ID="S-38926">As multiple levels of rules can lead to the same permutation with different probabilities, we take the weighted sum of probabilities from all matching rules (with the same rhs).</S>
          <S ID="S-38927">Therefore, the permutation decision is not based on any particular rule, but the combination of all the rules matching different</S>

          <S ID="S-38930">As opposed to the general syntax-based reordering approaches, this strategy achieves a desired balance between broad rule coverage and specific rule match: when a fully lexicalized rule matches, it has strong influence on the permutation decision given the richer context.</S>
          <S ID="S-38931">If such specific rule is unavailable or has low probability, more general (partial and unlexicalized) rules will have higher weights.</S>

      <HEADER>4 Experiments</HEADER>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-38948">We applied the generalized syntax-based reordering on both English-Chinese (EnZh) and English-Japanese (EnJa) translations.</S>
        <S ID="S-38949">Our English parser is IBM&#8217;s maximum entropy constituent parser (Ratnaparkhi 1999) trained on Penn Treebank.</S>
        <S ID="S-38950">Experiments in (Visweswariah et.</S>
        <S ID="S-38951">al. 2010) indicated that minimal difference was observed using Berkeley&#8217;s parser or IBM&#8217;s parser for reordering.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-38952">Our EnZh training data consists of 20 million sentence pairs (~250M words), half of which are from LDC released bilingual corpora and the other half are from technical domains (e.g., software manual).</S>
        <S ID="S-38953">We first trained automatic word alignments (HMM alignments in both directions and a MaxEnt alignment (Ittycheriah and Roukos, 2005)), then parsed the English sentences with the IBM parser.</S>
        <S ID="S-38954">We extracted different reordering rules from the word alignments and the English parse trees.</S>

        <S ID="S-38957">frequency-based pruning, we obtained 12M lexicalized rules, 13M partially lexicalized rules and 600K unlexicalized rules.</S>
        <S ID="S-38958">Using these rules, we applied preordering on the English sentences and then built an SMT system with the reordered training data.</S>
        <S ID="S-38959">Our decoder is a phrase-based decoder (Tillman 2006), where various features are combined within the log-linear framework.</S>
        <S ID="S-38960">These features include source-to-target phrase translation score based on relative frequency, source-to-target and target-to-source word-toword translation scores, a 5-gram language model score, distortion model scores and word count.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-38961">We selected one tuning set from software manual domain (Tech1), and used PRO tuning (Hopkins and May 2011) to select decoder feature weights.</S>
        <S ID="S-38962">Our test sets include one from the online technical support domain (Tech2) and one from the news domain: the NIST MT08 English-Chinese evaluation test data.</S>
        <S ID="S-38963">The translation quality is measured by BLEU score (Papineni et.</S>
        <S ID="S-38964">al., 2001).</S>
        <S ID="S-38965">Table 1 shows the BLEU score of the baseline phrase-based system (PBMT) that uses lexicalized reordering at decoding time rather than preordering.</S>
        <S ID="S-38966">Next, Table 1 shows the translation results with several preordered systems that use unlexicalized (UnLex), fully lexicalized (FullLex) and partially lexicalized (PartLex) rules, respectively.</S>
        <S ID="S-38967">The lexicalized reordering model is still applicable for preordered systems so that some preordering errors can be recovered at run time.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-38968">First we observed that the UnLex preordering model on average does not improve over the typical phrase-based MT baseline due to its limited discriminative power.</S>
        <S ID="S-38969">When the preordering decision is conditioned on the head word, the FullLex model shows some gains (~0.3 pt) thanks to the richer matching context, while the PartLex model improves further over the FullLex model because of its broader coverage.</S>
        <S ID="S-38970">Combining all three with multipermutation, multi-level rule matching (MPML) brings the most gains, with consistent (~1.3 Bleu points) improvement over the baseline system on all the test sets.</S>
        <S ID="S-38971">Note that the Bleu scores on the news domain (MT08) are higher than those on the tech domain.</S>
        <S ID="S-38972">This is because the Tech1 and Tech2 have one reference translation while MT08 has 4 reference translations.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-38973">In addition to the automatic MT evaluation, we also used human judgment of quality of the MT translation on a set of randomly selected 125 sentences from the baseline and improved reordering systems.</S>
        <S ID="S-38974">The human judgment score is 2.82 for the UnLex system output, and 3.04 for the improved MPML reordering output.</S>
        <S ID="S-38975">The 0.2 point improvement on the 0-5 scale is considered significant.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-38976">We also apply the same generalized reordering technique on English-Japanese (EnJa) translation.</S>
        <S ID="S-38977">As there is very limited publicly available English-Japanese parallel data, most our training data (20M sentence pairs) is from the in-house software manual domain.</S>
        <S ID="S-38978">We use the same English parser and phrase-based decoder as in EnZh experiment.</S>
        <S ID="S-38979">Table 2 shows the translation results on technical and news domain test sets.</S>
        <S ID="S-38980">All the test sets have single reference translation.</S>
      </P>
      <P>
        <S ID="S-38981">First, we observe that the improvement from preordering is larger than that in EnZh MT (1.6-3 pts vs. 1 pt).</S>
        <S ID="S-38982">This is because the word order difference between English and Japanese is larger than that between English and Chinese (Japanese is a SOV language while both English and Chinese are SVO languages).</S>
        <S ID="S-38983">Without preordering, correct word orders are difficult to obtain given the typical skip-window beam search in the PBMT.</S>
        <S ID="S-38984">Also, as in EnZh, the PartLex model outperforms the UnLex model, both of which being significantly better than the FullLex model due to the limited rule coverage in the later model: only 50% preordering rules</S>
      </P>

      <P>
        <S ID="S-38987">To summarize, we made the following improvements: 1.</S>
        <S ID="S-38988">We generalized fully lexicalized reordering rules to partially lexicalized and unlexicalized rules for broader rule coverage and reduced data sparseness.</S>
        <S ID="S-38989">2.</S>
        <S ID="S-38990">We allowed multiple permutation, multilevel rule matching to select the best reordering path.</S>
        <S ID="S-38991">Experiment results show consistent and significant improvements on multiple English- Chinese and English-Japanese test sets judged by both automatic and human judgments.</S>
        <S ID="S-38992">In future work we would like to explore new methods to prune the phrase table without degrading MT performance and to make rule extraction and reordering more robust to parsing errors.</S>
